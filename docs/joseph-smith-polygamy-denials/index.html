    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Joseph Smith denied the practice of polygamy<sup id="fnref:polygamydenials"><a href="#fn:polygamydenials" class="footnote">1</a></sup> on several occasions.  He was also responsible for the publication or distribution of several additional denials.  A complete listing of early Church leader polygamy denials up to 1850 is <a href="/a_careful_examination/documents/polygamy/denials/denial_analysis.pdf">available here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<em>No, not at the same time</em>. But they believe that if their companion dies, they have a right to marry again. But we do disapprove of the custom, which has gained in the world, and has been practiced among us, to our great mortification, in marrying in five or six weeks, or even in two or three months, after the death of their companion.  We believe that due respect ought to be had to the memory of the dead, and the feelings of both friends and children.</p>

<p><em>The rumor about being shut in a room for <strong>several days</strong> is almost certainly false, but the general outline of Martha Brotherton’s story <a href="/a_careful_examination/martha-brotherton-affidavit/">as contained in her affidavit</a> is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mormonscholar/comments/5xv15u/the_joseph_smithpolygamywomen_locked_in_a_room/">likely truthful</a>.  Joseph Smith had at least 8 wives when these words were spoken.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He [Hyrum Smith] then spoke in contradiction of a report in circulation about Elder Kimball, B. Young, himself, and others of the Twelve, alleging that a sister had been shut in a room for several days, <em>and that they had endeavored to induce her to believe in having two wives</em> …</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pres’t. J. Smith spoke upon the subject of the stories respecting Elder Kimball and others, showing the folly and inconsistency of spending any time in conversing about such stories or hearkening to them, for <em>there is no person that is acquainted with our principles would believe such lies</em>, except Sharp the editor of the “Warsaw Signal.”</p>

Heber C. Kimball also took his first polygamous wife <a href="https://imgur.com/1ShyRKR">early in 1842</a>.

The extract is from the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, <em>and is the only rule allowed by the church</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“All legal contracts of marriage made before a person is baptized into this church, should be held sacred and fulfilled. Inasmuch as this church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication, and polygamy: <em>we declare that we believe, that one man should have one wife; and one woman, but one husband</em>, except in case of death, when either is at liberty to marry again. It is not right to persuade a woman to be baptized contrary to the will of her husband neither is it lawful to influence her to leave her husband.”</p>

<p><em>John Taylor was <a href="http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/NCMP1820-1846/id/9200">editor of the Times and Seasons</a>, was in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anointed_Quorum">Joseph’s inner circle</a>, and <a href="http://www.lds-mormon.com/quinn_dialogue.shtml">had likely been taught about polygamy by this time</a>. Taylor would take a plural wife <a href="https://restorationbookstore.org/articles/nopoligamy/jsfp-vol2/2chp17.htm">before the end of 1843</a>.  Joseph lived in Nauvoo when this statement was published in Nauvoo.  He had at least 17 wives at this time.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>We are charged with advocating a plurality of wives</em>, and common property. <em>Now this is as false as the many other ridiculous charges which are brought against us</em>.

R.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="appendix-b-letter-to-thomas-carlin">Appendix-B Letter to Thomas Carlin</h3>

<p>In his letter to Illinois Governor Thomas Carlin, Joseph Smith discusses Bennett’s claims which included the idea that leaders above him were giving sanction to the same practice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More than twelve months ago Bennett went to a Lady in the City and began to teach her that promiscuous intercourse between the sexes was lawful and no harm in it, and requested the privilege of gratifying his passions but she refused in the strongest terms saying that it was very wrong to do so, and it would bring a disgrace on the church Finding this argument ineffectual <strong>he told her that men in higher standing in the church than himself not only sanctioned but practised the same deeds, and in order to finish the controversy said and affirmed that I both taught and acted in [p. 233] the same manner, but publicly proclaimed against it in consequence of the prejudace of the people and fear of trouble in my own house.</strong> (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Joseph Smith Papers editors footnote the block quote above:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By this time, JS had apparently been sealed to several women in Nauvoo. Bennett may have had some knowledge of these sealings and may have been referring to plural marriage in his accusations against JS. JS’s practice of plural marriage, however—which included a proposal, a religious ceremony, and at least one witness—did not resemble Bennett’s claims about JS’s conduct. (See, for example, Mary Elizabeth Rollins Lightner, Affidavit, Minersville, Utah Territory, 23 Mar. 1877, Collected Material concerning Joseph Smith and Plural Marriage, CHL; and Presendia Lathrop Huntington Kimball, Affidavit, Salt Lake Co., Utah Territory, 1 May 1869, in Joseph F. Smith, Affidavits about Celestial Marriage, 1:7.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While never directly denying Bennett’s charges, Joseph Smith goes on to state, “It can be proven by hundreds of witnesses that he is one of the basest of liars that his whole routine of proceedings whilst amongst us has been of the basest kind.”</p>

<h3 id="appendix-c-denials-discussed-in-ldsorg-essay">Appendix-C Denials discussed in lds.org essay</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo?lang=eng">Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo</a> essay on lds.org states the following about the denials (as of 2017-05-07):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rumors prompted members and leaders to issue carefully worded denials that denounced spiritual wifery and polygamy but were silent about what Joseph Smith and others saw as divinely mandated “celestial” plural marriage.[22]  The statements emphasized that the Church practiced no marital law other than monogamy while implicitly leaving open the possibility that individuals, under direction of God’s living prophet, might do so.[23]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They reference the following footnotes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[22]: In the denials, “polygamy” was understood to mean the marriage of one man to more than one woman but without Church sanction.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[23]: See, for example, “On Marriage,” Times and Seasons, Oct. 1, 1842, 939–40; and Wilford Woodruff journal, Nov. 25, 1843, Church History Library, Salt Lake City; Parley P. Pratt, “This Number Closes the First Volume of the ‘Prophet,’” The Prophet, May 24, 1845, 2. George A. Smith explained, “Any one who will read carefully the denials, as they are termed, of plurality of wives in connection with the circumstances will see clearly that they denounce adultery, fornication, brutal lust and the teaching of plurality of wives by those who were not commanded to do so” (George A. Smith letter to Joseph Smith III, Oct. 9, 1869, in Journal History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Oct. 9, 1869, Church History Library, Salt Lake City).</p>

      <p><em>OWN WORDS</em> are statements directly attributable to Joseph Smith and are highly likely to reflect the precise words he spoke on that occasion.  <em>RESPONSIBLE FOR</em> means he had immediate stewardship over the contents of the publication (Times and Seasons) or directly promoted its distribution (Affidavits against Bennett).

Regardless, Joseph never contradicted or corrected these statements, and there is no reason to believe he wasn’t aware of their publication.  As editor he was nominally responsible for the contents of the periodical, and given his close association with Taylor and Woodruff, it seems reasonable to hold Joseph responsible for these statements.  <em>POSSIBLY AWARE OF</em> is associated with a denial in the Times and Seasons that Joseph may have been aware of. <a href="#fnref:explanationoftags" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Joseph Smith’s wife count is comprised of all those to whom he was married or sealed at the time of the statement and is derived from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/5vs93e/table_of_the_dates_of_joseph_smiths_marriages/">the most conservative estimate of well-established dates</a> for his marriages/sealings taken from <a href="http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/">josephsmithspolygamy.org</a>. <a href="#fnref:wifecount" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Virtually all scholars agree that <em>some</em> kind of sexual relationship or marriage occurred between Joseph and Fanny Alger.

      <p>Joseph Smith was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170918040702/https://restorationbookstore.org/articles/nopoligamy/jsfp-vol2/2chp1.htm">responsible for</a> the printing and spread of the affidavits against Bennett, which included several testimonies devoted to undermining the character and earlier affidavit of Martha Brotherton.  Joseph Smith’s <a href="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-december-1841-december-1842/59">journal entry for Friday, August 26th, 1842</a>, reads (emphasis added):</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>In the evening in council with some of the Twelve and others, He [Joseph] gave some very important instructions upon the situation of matters, <strong>showing that it was necessary that the officers who could, should go abroad through the States</strong>; and inasmuch as a great excitement had been raised, through the community at large, by the falsehoods put in circulation by John C. Bennett and others it was wisdom in God that the Elders should go forth and deluge the States with a flood of truth; setting forth the mean, contemptible, persecuting conduct of ex-Governor [Lilburn W.] Boggs of Missouri and those connected with him in his mean, and corrupt proceedings in plain terms, so that the world might understand the abusive conduct of our enemies, and stamp it with indignation. He [Joseph] <strong>advised the Twelve to call a special conference on Monday next to give instructions to the Elders and call upon them to go forth upon this important mission</strong>, meantime, <strong>that all the affidavits concerning Bennetts conduct be taken and printed so that each Elder could be properly furnished with correct and weighty testimony to lay before the public</strong>.</p>

      <p>John Taylor and Wilford Woodruff were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anointed_Quorum">original members of the Quorum of the Annointed</a> founded in early 1842.
