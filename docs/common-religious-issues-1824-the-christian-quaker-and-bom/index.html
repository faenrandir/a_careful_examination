    <p>In discussing the idea of revelation and whether perfection is attainable, the authors of the book <a href="https://archive.org/embed/christianquakerh00penn">The Christian Quaker, and his divine testimony stated and vindicated</a>, published in Philadelphia in 1824, rhetorically point to disagreements among Christians at that time (<a href="https://archive.org/details/christianquakerh00penn/page/288/mode/2up?q=devil">page 289</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nay, further, do you not much differ among yourselves in several principal matters? As about personal election, and general redemption, and so about the death of Christ, whether for all, or some, and about free will, the seventh-day sabbath, and laying on of hands, and about the manner of administering your pretended Lord’s supper, and about the immortality of the soul: some also affirming water baptism to be of necessity to salvation, others not, with several other things ; and yet most of you that thus differ, profess the scriptures to be your rule. If then I should from hence argue, that therefore the scriptures are not the rule, because you that profess them to be so, are repugnant one to another, thou wouldst readily reflect absurdity upon me, though to the undermining of thy own cause. …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Book of Mormon spends considerable time on, or at least weighs in on,
almost all of these points.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Personal election (Alma 31:16-17, 2 Nephi 2:27; Alma 13)</li>
  <li>General redemption (not exactly sure what this references, but the Book of
Mormon is all about how redemption works and who qualifies)</li>
  <li>Whether the death of Christ was for all or some (resurrection for all; salvation for the truly penitent, e.g., Alma 42:22-24)</li>
  <li>Free will (redundant with “Personal election”? 2 Nephi 2:27)</li>
  <li>The seventh-day Sabbath (observance, but not day, discussed in Mosiah 18:23, 25)</li>
  <li>Laying on of hands (Moroni 2:2)</li>
  <li>Manner of administering the Lord’s supper (exact instructions: Moroni 4:3, 5:2)</li>
  <li>The immortality of the soul (immortal, spirit and body separate at death
and reunite after: Alma 40)</li>
  <li>Whether water baptism is necessary to salvation or not (essential: 2 Ne 9:23-24, 2 Ne 31; 3 Ne 11:20-40)</li>
  <li>Whether the scriptures are the only necessary rule for conduct [this is the focus of the whole section] (2 Nephi 32)</li>
</ol>

<p>Originally heard about The Christian Quaker from /u/TruthIsAntiMormon, but the
observation above is mine (however, use of Alma 31 in reference to election
was pointed out by them).</p>
