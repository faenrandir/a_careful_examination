<h3 id="we-can-know-that-the-book-of-mormon-is-true-because-it-was-written-so-quickly">We can know that the Book of Mormon is true because it was written so quickly!</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/ensign/1988/01/i-have-a-question/how-long-did-it-take-joseph-smith-to-translate-the-book-of-mormon?lang=eng">www.churchofjesuschrist.org</a>: One of the most amazing facts about the Book of Mormon is that it took Joseph Smith only about sixty-five working days to translate a book that, in the current edition, is 531 pages long.</p>

<h3 id="we-can-know-that-the-quran-is-true-because-it-took-so-long-to-write">We can know that the Quran is true because it took so long to write!</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.thewaytotruth.org/theholyquran/wordofgod.html">www.thewaytotruth.org</a>: The Quran was revealed in 23 years, yet there are not any contradictory points in it. It is inconceivable that any book written by a mortal being in 23 years, one which is a book of Divine truths, metaphysics, religious beliefs and worship, prayer, law and morality, a book fully describing the other life, a book of psychology, sociology, epistemology, and history, and a book containing scientific facts and the principles of a happy life, does not have any contradictory points. Whereas, the Quran openly declares that it has no contradictions at all and therefore is a Divine Book.</p>
