    <p>[draft notes]</p>

<p>Researchers compile scripts for various kinds of crime (introduced <a href="https://popcenter.asu.edu/sites/default/files/Library/CrimePrevention/Volume_03/06_cornish.pdf">by Cornish in 1994</a>), and researchers have compiled scripts for sexual abuse (e.g., <a href="https://www.aic.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-05/tandi497.pdf">Leclerc and Cale in 2015</a>). The recent analysis of how Coaches perpetrated sex offenses by <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.856798/full">St-Pierre et al. in 2022</a>) provides a scaffold of <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/856798/fpsyg-13-856798-HTML/image_m/fpsyg-13-856798-t002.jpg">frequent script components</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Targeting a potential victim (i.e., targeting those who were vulnerable)</li>
  <li>Gaining trust (e.g., befriending an athlete, complimenting them, etc)</li>
  <li>Developing dependency and exerting control (e.g., telling the athlete that he/she needs them to succeed)</li>
  <li>Isolating the athlete (inviting the athlete to their home)</li>
  <li>Gaining cooperation (offering or promising benefits in exchange for sexual favors)</li>
  <li>Maintaining silence</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-list">The list</h2>

<p>[Do we want to highlight this list or create my own?]</p>

<p>In 2016, an unnamed blogger at 116pages argued that that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230207175620/http://www.116pages.com/2016/08/">Joseph Smith was a sexual predator</a>.  Their self-proclaimed expertise on the topic was that they “often give presentations to the students about the dangers they face from online sexual predators” and that they “go through the patterns that predators use to entice young girls and boys and the precautions students need to take in order to stay safe.”</p>

<p>[Ideally, interspersed with Hales’s response and curious mormon’s response to Hales (and/or my response to Hales)]</p>

<ol>
