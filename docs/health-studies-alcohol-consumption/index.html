    <p>Note: two recent, very comprehensive studies suggest that alcohol <a href="https://www.jsad.com/doi/abs/10.15288/jsad.2017.78.375?journalCode=jsad">isn’t as great for protecting against heart disease as previously thought</a> and that <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31571-X/fulltext">no level of alcohol was beneficial for overall health</a>.  I believe these studies supercede the research discussed below.</p>

<hr />

<p>Drinking alcohol (moderately or heavily) is good for heart health, and since heart disease is the number one cause of death in America, drinking makes you live longer.  Here’s a synopsis from a <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2017200,00.html">recent article in Time</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But even after controlling for nearly all imaginable variables — socioeconomic status, level of physical activity, number of close friends, quality of social support and so on — the researchers (a six-member team led by psychologist Charles Holahan of the University of Texas at Austin) found that over a 20-year period, mortality rates were highest for those who were not current drinkers, regardless of whether they used to be alcoholics, second highest for heavy drinkers and lowest for moderate drinkers.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are remarkable statistics. Even though heavy drinking is associated with higher risk for cirrhosis and several types of cancer (particularly cancers in the mouth and esophagus), heavy drinkers are less likely to die than people who don’t drink, even if they never had a problem with alcohol</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It does increase your risk of getting certain kinds of cancers, so that’s worth considering.  But these cancers don’t kill nearly as many people as heart disease.</p>

<p>Here’s an abstract from a recent review of alcohol from a scholarly journal (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22852062">Nutrients. 2012 Jul</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since ancient times, people have attributed a variety of health benefits to moderate consumption of fermented beverages such as wine and beer, often without any scientific basis. There is evidence that excessive or binge alcohol consumption is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, as well as with work related and traffic accidents. On the contrary, at the moment, several epidemiological studies have suggested that moderate consumption of alcohol reduces overall mortality, mainly from coronary diseases. However, there are discrepancies regarding the specific effects of different types of beverages (wine, beer and spirits) on the cardiovascular system and cancer, and also whether the possible protective effects of alcoholic beverages are due to their alcoholic content (ethanol) or to their non-alcoholic components (mainly polyphenols). Epidemiological and clinical studies have pointed out that regular and moderate wine consumption (one to two glasses a day) is associated with decreased incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, diabetes, and certain types of cancer, including colon, basal cell, ovarian, and prostate carcinoma. Moderate beer consumption has also been associated with these effects, but to a lesser degree, probably because of beer’s lower phenolic content. These health benefits have mainly been attributed to an increase in antioxidant capacity, changes in lipid profiles, and the anti-inflammatory effects produced by these alcoholic beverages. This review summarizes the main protective effects on the cardiovascular system and cancer resulting from moderate wine and beer intake due mainly to their common components, alcohol and polyphenols.</p>
