    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that the Holy Ghost (aka the Spirit) is central to understanding truth.<sup id="fnref:understanding_truth"><a href="#fn:understanding_truth" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Knowledge gained by the Holy Ghost is considered the foundation of a testimony, which is, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/general-conference/2008/04/testimony?lang=eng">according to Elder Dallin H. Oaks</a>, a “personal witness borne to our souls by the Holy Ghost that certain facts of eternal significance are true and that we know them to be true.”</p>

<h3 id="lds-description">LDS description</h3>

<p>The Preach My Gospel manual, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/how-do-i-recognize-and-understand-the-spirit?lang=eng">chapter 4</a>, gives a clear and understandable summary of the kinds of phenomena meant to indicate an experience with the Holy Ghost.  Those most directly related to mental and physical phenomena are reproduced below:<sup id="fnref:complete_list"><a href="#fn:complete_list" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>“Gives feelings of love, joy, peace, patience, meekness, gentleness, faith, and hope.”</li>
  <li>“Gives ideas in the mind, feelings in the heart.”</li>
  <li>“Occupies the mind and presses on the feelings.”</li>
  <li>“Helps scriptures have strong effect.”</li>
  <li>“Gives good feelings to teach if something is true.”</li>
  <li>“Enlightens the mind.”</li>
  <li>“Replaces darkness with light.”</li>
  <li>“Strengthens the desire to avoid evil and obey the commandments.”</li>
  <li>“Teaches truth and brings it to remembrance.”</li>
  <li>“Gives feelings of peace and comfort.”</li>
  <li>“Guides to truth and shows things to come.”</li>
  <li>“Reveals truth.”</li>
  <li>“Guides and protects from deception.”</li>
  <li>“Helps to perceive or discern the thoughts of others.”</li>
  <li>“Tells what to pray for.”</li>
  <li>“Tells what to do.”</li>
  <li>“Edifies both teacher and students.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="potential-phenomenological-explanations">Potential phenomenological explanations</h3>

<p>Based on the above list and common descriptions (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/new-era/2010/09/feeling-the-spirit?lang=eng">for example</a>), what is perceived as an LDS spiritual experience (or the Spirit or Holy Ghost) may be postulated to involve one or more of these elements:<sup id="fnref:different_perspectives"><a href="#fn:different_perspectives" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<ol>
  <li>A feeling of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation_%28emotion%29">elevation</a>: this is a hormonally-mediated feeling that produces a “swelling” feeling in the chest and is generated when witnessing or performing altruistic acts or participating in acts of transcendent beauty.<sup id="fnref:oxytocin"><a href="#fn:oxytocin" class="footnote">4</a></sup></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisson">Frisson</a>: “a psychophysiological response to rewarding auditory and/or visual stimuli that often induces a pleasurable or otherwise positively-valenced affective state.”</li>
  <li>The warm glow of familiarity (aka “glow of warmth”): We resonate with things we are already familiar with. There is also a tendency to believe information to be correct after repeated exposure known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_truth_effect">illusory truth effect</a> (e.g., <a href="/a_careful_examination/lds-indoctrination-and-retentive-socialization/">retentive socialization and indoctrination</a> within the LDS Church).  This may be why a Latter-day Saint doesn’t feel exactly the same “Spirit” when they attend a Catholic service and why the Catholic also doesn’t feel exactly the same “spirit” attending an LDS service.</li>
  <li>Some kind of <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/internal-speech-is-driven-by-predictive-brain-signal.html">inner speech</a> or <a href="https://faculty.unlv.edu/hurlburt/sampling.html">inner experience</a> may be responsible for some aspects of the mind engagement suggested by <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.2?lang=eng">D&amp;C 8:2</a> “I will tell you in your <em>mind</em> and in your heart” (D&amp;C 8:2).</li>
  <li>Congruence with accepted LDS doctrine or current policy.  Although the relationship is probably complex, it seems reasonable to postulate that oxytocin release is related to <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/feb08/oxytocin.aspx">tend and befriend</a> proclivities.  Hence, rumination on ideas which are accepted by one’s group are more likely to initiate strong oxytocin type responses.  Formally speaking, any inspiration which is received that does not affirm LDS doctrine and current policy is not considered <em>The Spirit</em> by Latter-day Saints.<sup id="fnref:1913_first_presidency_statement"><a href="#fn:1913_first_presidency_statement" class="footnote">5</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="what-is-it-like">What is it like?</h3>

<p>Since so many mental and physical states may be associated with feeling the
Spirit, it’s difficult to know for sure if others are feeling the same
feelings/states (in part or in totality).  Still, certain expressions outside
of the LDS faith seem consistent with expressions that come from within
the LDS faith:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJMSU8Qj6Go">Spiritual Witnesses</a> (youtube compilation)</li>
  <li><a href="https://testimoniesofotherfaiths.blogspot.com/">Testimonies of Other Faiths</a> (collection of anecdotes)</li>
</ul>

<p>Especially if some or all of the above phenomenological explanations hold
true, then perhaps it is possible to simulate aspects of an LDS spiritual
experience by those who are not members of the faith (or even members who have
struggled to feel the Spirit) through some meditation exercises. To be clear,
guided meditation is not usually the <em>manner</em> in which Latter-day Saints
prepare themselves to experience the Spirit, but the act of prayer, deep
reflection during scripture reading, or deep reflection during the temple
ceremony or in the Celestial room may be invoking similar kinds of reflection
and hence spiritual, mental, and physical processes.</p>

      <p>The LDS Church teaches that the Holy Ghost is central to understanding truth:</p>

        <li>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/nt/john/14.26">John 14:26</a>)</li>

      <p>Certain psychophysiological experiences may correlate with a spiritual experience, as described above. A naturalist may suggest that the entirety of the experience could be explained by appeal to such mechanisms.  On the other hand, many believing Latter-day Saint could argue that these experiences are initiated or driven by encounters with the Holy Ghost and largely mediated by spirit to spirit communication apart from human physiology.  Other Latter-day Saints would argue that psychophysiological phenomena either correlate with, or are part of God-given mechanisms used to convey or enhance spiritual experiences. <a href="#fnref:different_perspectives" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
