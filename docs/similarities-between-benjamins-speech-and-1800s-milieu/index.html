<p>There are many parallels between King Bejamin’s speech (found in Mosiah 2–5) and phrases and ideas already present in Joseph Smith’s early 1800s milieu. The first sections focus on phrases/ideas from specific verses.<sup id="fnref:tompainesbones"><a href="#fn:tompainesbones" class="footnote">1</a></sup> The second section looks more generally at Mosiah 2–5, primarily in table form.</p>
