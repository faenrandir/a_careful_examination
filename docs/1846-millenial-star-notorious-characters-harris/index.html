    <p>From The Latter-day Saints’ <a href="https://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/digital/collection/MStar/id/938">Millennial Star Vol. 08</a>; “Sketches of Notorious Characters”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MARTIN HARRIS</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the witnesses to the Book of Mormon, yielded to the spirit and temptation of the Devil a number of years ago—turned against Joseph Smith and became his bitter enemy. He was filled with the rage and madness of a demon. <strong>One day he would be one thing, and another day another thing. He soon became partially deranged or shattered, as many believed, flying from one thing to another, as if reason and common sense were thrown off their balance</strong>.  In one of his fits of monomania, he went and joined the ‘‘ Shakers” or followers of Anne Lee. He tarried with them a year or two, or perhaps longer, having had some flare ups while among them; but since Strang has made his entry into the apostate ranks, and hoisted his standard for the rebellious to flock too, Martin leaves the “Shakers,” whom he knows to be right, and has known it for many years, as he said, and joins Strang in gathering out the tares of the field. We understand that he is appointed a mission to this country, but we do not feel to warn the Saints against him, for <strong>his own unbridled tongue will soon show out specimens of folly enough to give any person a true index to the character of the man</strong>; but if the Saints wish to know what the Lord hath said of him, they may turn to the 178th pase of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, and the person there called a “wicked man” is no other than Martin Harris, and he owned to it then, but probably might not now. It is not the first time the Lord chose a wicked man as a witness. Also on page 193, read the whole revelation given to him, and ask yourselves if the Lord ever talked in that way to a good man. Every one can see that he must have been a wicked man, and the Lord said that that revelation was the last he should receive; and no wonder that &amp; man without revelation should join Anne Lee, Strang, or any other imposition or strong delusion, having rejected the truth.</p>
