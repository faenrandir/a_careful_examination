<p>Portions of the talk were reproduced in Teachings of Presidents of the Church, Joseph Smith, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-8.p1?lang=eng">chapter 8</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There has been a chain of authority and power from Adam down to the present time.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Priesthood was first given to Adam; he obtained the First Presidency, and held the keys of it from generation to generation. He obtained it in the Creation, before the world was formed, as in Gen. 1:26, 27, 28. He had dominion given him over every living creature. He is Michael the Archangel, spoken of in the Scriptures. Then to Noah, who is Gabriel; he stands next in authority to Adam in the Priesthood; he was called of God to this office, and was the father of all living in his day, and to him was given the dominion. These men held keys first on earth, and then in heaven.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is held by some that Adam was not the first man upon this earth, and that the original human being was a development from lower orders of the animal creation. These, however, are the theories of men. The word of the Lord declares that Adam was ‘the first man of all men’ (Moses 1:34), and we are therefore in duty bound to regard him as the primal parent of our race.</p>

<p>As counselor in the First Presidency, Joseph Fielding Smith responded to a request for doctrinal clarification by Morris L. Reynolds.  <a href="http://www.utlm.org/images/curseofcain/curseofcain_p116appendixc.gif">Joseph Fielding Smith wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The doctrine concerning Adam has been distorted.  You may accept what has been given us by revelation, and I call your attention to the Doctrine and Covenants.  In Section 29, verses 23 to 34, you will find some interesting information in relation to Adam.  It is also true that Adam being the first man, will eventually preside over his posterity as outlined in the Doctrine and Covenants, Section 107, verses 53 to 56, and in Section 78: 15-16, which are as follows:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Who hath appointed Michael (Adam) your prince, and established his feet, and set him upon high, and given unto him the keys of salvation under the counsel and direction of the Holy One (Jesus Christ), who is without beginning of days or end of life. (Verse 16.)</p>

<p>Ugo Perego corresponded directly with the office of the New Era asking about statements there (he was specifically interested in this and other similar statements on evolution) and was told that “nothing ends up published in Church magazines without the approval of a priesthood committee that acts under the direct supervision of the Brethern [sic]” and that “nothing is published that would not be in line with their teachings.”</p>
