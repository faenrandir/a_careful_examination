    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In early 2017, the salary/stipend amount of LDS General Authorities (GAs) <a href="https://mormonleaks.io/newsroom/2017-01-09-mormonleaks-releases-4-documents/">was leaked</a>.  The Church owned <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865670786/MormonLeaks-dumps-four-new-documents-about-LDS-Church.html">Deseret News stated</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The church long has been transparent about providing living allowances to General Authorities</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While technically accurate (the practice of compensating GAs <em>was</em> disclosed in 1985 in the male-only Priesthood session of General Conference), the question remains as to how broadly transparent the LDS Church has been with leadership compensation.  How often are members or journalists led to believe that the Church pays no one, and how often is GA compensation explicitly mentioned?</p>

<p>This document seeks to establish the extent to which the LDS Church has been transparent in providing living allowances to General Authorities.  First, I present every statement made by the Church or leaders that seems relevant to perceptions about General Authority living allowances.  Second, I conduct several searches on lds.org using relevant phrases to determine the extent to which the search results provide transparency.  Next, I examine a series of linked LDS Newsroom articles discussing the LDS Church’s unpaid clergy to show the extent to which, in practice, the LDS Church is transparent with GA compensation.  Finally, I reference anecdotes demonstrating that members themselves frequently taught that no one (including the General Authorities) were paid.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>General authorities leave their careers when they are called into full-time church service. When they do so, they focus all of their time on serving the church and are given a living allowance. The living allowance is uniform for all general authorities [including First Presidency, Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, First and Second Quorums of the Seventy and Presiding Bishopric].</p>

<p><em>Note that the following statement was given in the Priesthood Session of General Conference which is not attended by women.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I should like to add, parenthetically for your information that the living allowances given the General Authorities, which are very modest in comparison with executive compensation in industry and the professions, come from this business income and not from the tithing of the people.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unlike local leaders, who maintain their normal vocations while serving in Church assignments, General Authorities set aside their careers to devote their full time to the ministry of their office. The living allowance given General Authorities rarely if ever equals the earnings they sacrifice to serve full-time in the Church.</p>

  <p>In these verses, reference is made to the bishop and his counselors receiving “a just remuneration for” their services. In our day, this refers specifically to General Authorities, mission presidents, and temple presidents who are required to give up their livelihoods to serve full time in the Church. These individuals receive a modest living allowance sufficient to support them and their immediate families during their time of service.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And the fact that faithful members of the Church do all these things is one of the great evidences of the divinity of the work… Where [else] is there so much unpaid teaching and church administration? In the true church we neither preach for hire nor divine for money. We follow the pattern of Paul and make the gospel of Christ without charge , lest we abuse or misuse the power the Lord has given us. Freely we have received and freely we give, for salvation is free.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No one—husband, wife, children, or church—has claim on the full time of someone else. Children, given their parents’ full-time attention, would be overshadowed and become dependent. The Church, with full-time bishops, would have a paid ministry and become an end in itself rather than a divine organization designed to help perfect the individual children of God.</p>

  <p>Why does the Church have unpaid clergy?  From the beginning, the Lord has called His disciples from among ordinary people with diverse backgrounds. They served out of love for the Lord and for others. In the Book of Mormon, for instance, the prophet Alma chose priesthood leaders and “commanded them … [to] labor with their own hands for their support. “And the priests were not to depend upon the people for their support; but for their labor they were to receive the grace of God” (Mosiah 18:24, 26; see also 2 Nephi 26:29–31; Articles of Faith 1:5).  Likewise in our day, a call to serve gives us the opportunity to help others and to develop and share our talents and spiritual gifts. We are amply repaid for our service by blessings from the Lord.</p>

<h2 id="ldsorg-search-results">lds.org search results</h2>

<p>I performed searches of various terms relevant to General Authority living allowances to see how widely and in what manner the Church disburses information on GA allowances.</p>

<p><em>Searches were performed in the lds.org search bar on 2017-03-09 and 2017-03-10</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>“living allowance” or “living allowances”</strong> — 5 distinct sources: 1) The D&amp;C and Church History Seminary Teacher Manual [two quotes] 2) The home study lesson manual, 3) the quote about new mission presidents (mission presidents), and 4) the story in a BYU speech by Derrick (mission presidents). 5) Questions and Answers (living allowance given the GAs)</li>
  <li><strong>“living stipend”</strong> — zero hits related to GA allowances.</li>
  <li><strong>“unpaid clergy”</strong> — 4 distinct and relevant results: 1) “Islands of Light” (technical distinction; might be construed incorrectly), 2) “Whom the Lord Calls He Qualifies” (gives impression all are unpaid), 3) “The Gospel Restored” (gives impression all are unpaid), 4) “Bishop” Mormon Newsroom (“this position is unpaid”)</li>
  <li><strong>“no paid ministry”</strong> — 5 distinct and relevant results: 1) 1977 New Era (gives impression all unpaid) 2) “Follow the Brethren” (gives impression all unpaid), 3) “What’s the Difference?” (gives impression all unpaid), 4) “Our Sacred Priesthood Trust” (gives impression all unpaid) 5) “Why Mormons Make Good Neighbors” (gives impression all unpaid)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>From a search of the 4 phrases shown above, we can sum up the relative disbursement of these ideas.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Two</strong> sources (if we group the related seminary manual quotes) clearly indicate that all General Authorities receive a “modest living allowance” (note that one was in 1985 in a priesthood session and the quotes in the seminary manuals are from the teacher manual or home-study manual and published in 2014).</li>
  <li><strong>Two</strong> sources indicate that a Mission President receives a modest allowance.</li>
  <li><strong>Five</strong> distinct sources give the impression that all leaders in the Church are unpaid.</li>
  <li><strong>One</strong> makes the proper technical distinction about local leaders salaries but may also be mis-construed that all leaders are unpaid.</li>
  <li><strong>One</strong> clearly indicates that a Bishop is unpaid.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lds-newsroom-obfuscation">LDS Newsroom obfuscation</h3>

<p>Statements on the LDS Newsroom about the lay, unpaid ministry appear to be carefully worded so as to lead readers unfamiliar with the compensation of General Authorities to mistakenly assume that LDS General Authorities are unpaid.<sup id="fnref:newsroomretrievaldate"><a href="#fn:newsroomretrievaldate" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>When visiting the page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181008012938/https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/blog/the-church-s-unpaid-clergy">The Church’s Unpaid Clergy</a> we find this nominally accurate—but somewhat misleading—verbiage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[members’] service is critical at the local level because the Church has no full-time paid clergy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phrase is interesting because it <em>begins</em> with the qualifying condition that “service is critical at the local level” but it ends with the all-inclusive and leading phrase “because the Church has no full-time paid clergy.”</p>

<p>Later, the article states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Elder M. Russell Ballard of the Church’s Quorum of Twelve Apostles spoke on the concept of an unpaid volunteer ministry:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Lord in His infinite wisdom has designed His Church to operate with a lay ministry. That means we have been charged to watch over one another and to serve one another…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we click on the link “[no] full-time paid clergy” we find <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181006015129/https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/topic/lay-priesthood">an article on Lay Priesthood</a> where we learn the “local congregational leader… earns his own living and receives no pay of any kind for his service in the Church.”  Below that, we find a link to the article <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190508153924/https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/mormon-lay-ministry">Lay Leadership: Volunteer Ministry of the Church</a>.  This article is “intended to help journalists, opinion leaders and the public better understand the structure of local ministration and leadership within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.” and includes a very nice infographic entitled “Lay Leadership: Volunteer Ministry of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints” summarizing duties of the Stake Presidency on down to ward auxiliaries and individuals.  The article states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints functions in large measure because of the unpaid volunteer ministry of its members. In fact, this lay ministry is one of the Church’s most defining characteristics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The end of the article has a link to learn more about global general authorities:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Church also has global general authorities and general auxiliary leaders. Read more about their various offices and responsibilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clicking on that link takes the reader to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190213075512/http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/general-authorities-of-the-church">a bulleted list of links to visit information pages of various General Authority and Auxiliary offices</a>.  Working through all 12 links provided and searching for the phrases “stipend”, “allowance”, “paid”, “compensated”, or “salary” yields no results—these pages completely avoid the topic of compensation.  So, whether deliberately or through oversight, the LDS Newsroom:</p>

<ul>
  <li>states that the LDS Church “has no full-time paid clergy”</li>
  <li>quotes Elder Ballard saying “The Lord … has designed His Church to operate with a lay ministry”</li>
  <li>and states that the Church “functions in large measure because of the unpaid volunteer ministry of its members”</li>
</ul>

<p>but it never divulges that global leadership receives a significant “allowance” associated with their service. The qualifier “local” is sometimes used, but never in a manner to exclude the possibility that GAs are paid.  A member or journalist who is unaware of GA allowances would not likely conclude that GAs are paid based on their traversal of these pages—many of which are dedicated exclusively to the topic of (un-)paid clergy.</p>

<h2 id="member-teachings-and-beliefs">Member teachings and beliefs</h2>

<p>[Represented through ~900 mormon.org member profiles containing an answer to the question “Why don’t Mormons have paid clergy?” and a few other off-hand anecdotes, for example online chats with missionaries]</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>[need to highlight quotes that are directly contradictory; need to present percentages]</p>

<p>[initial discussion, needs work] Given a member’s likely access to source material (i.e., most members will either not have been exposed to or will not remember an off-hand statement from their seminary teacher; only males older than 44 years old would have been present in the 1985 Priesthood Session), I conclude that in the past 30 years, a member was more likely to stumble on material suggesting all leaders are unpaid than material suggesting they all are paid.  Still, once a person understands that GAs are given a living allowance then all other statements will likely be interpreted in that light, and this makes the analysis more complex and suggests that even with limited statements indicating a living allowance, many members were likely aware of the living allowance.  Still, it stands to reason that a substantial number of members were not aware that all General Authorities are given a salary/stipend.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>Survey data of individuals in the U.S. and in other countries would be helpful to better undestand the percentage of members who know that GAs receive a living allowance.</p>
