<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Chiasmus in the Book of Mormon is frequently advanced by Latter-day Saint scholars as evidence favoring an ancient origin of the book (<a href="https://knowhy.bookofmormoncentral.org/knowhy/does-chiasmus-prove-anything-about-the-book-of-mormon">for example</a>).</p>

<p>Various naturalistic mechanisms for the presence of chiasmus in the Book of Mormon may be contemplated,[^naturalistic_explanations_for_chiasmus] but recently William Davis has advanced evidence and arguments suggesting that the Book of Mormon <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/86h814zv">exhibits patterns common to oral performance generally</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral-formulaic_composition">Oral Formulaic Theory</a>) and also patterns specific to the early 1800s (e.g., <a href="https://uncpress.org/book/9781469655666/visions-in-a-seer-stone/">laying down heads</a>).</p>

<p>Oral Formulaic Theory may help make some sense of a few observations, especially the length of some chiastic structures (like Alma 36) and the fact that Joseph never pointed out the chiasms and parallelisms in the Book of Mormon.  If Joseph was the author of the Book of Mormon and Joseph naturally employed these structures as part of the process of orally composing the Book of Mormon, then—to extend Davis’s hypothesis a bit—we might expect Joseph to spontaneously utilize repetition (including inversion and ring structures) as he composes other similar works orally, too, at least to some extent.</p>

<p>Some efforts have been made to identify chiasmus in other compositions which Joseph was responsible for including <a href="https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1571&amp;context=physics_facpub">an 1838 letter to Emma</a> and within the Doctrine and Covenants and Book of Abraham (see the study “Does Chiasmus Appear in the Book of Mormon by Chance?” in <a href="https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3644&amp;context=byusq">BYU Studies 43:2, 2004, 118-123</a>). According to the authors of the 2004 BYU Studies analysis, potential examples outside the Book of Mormon were deemed statistically insignificant and hence somewhat likely to have occurred by chance alone.</p>

<p>I recently happened upon <a href="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letterbook-1/26#X6E0ADA17-5772-44B3-926B-9A889F221AEF">an 1833 letter from Joseph Smith to a newspaper editor</a> that, at first glance, seemed somewhat reminiscent to me of the Book of Mormon in tone and style. Joseph appears to have assumed a prophetic or quasi-prophetic role during the letter (e.g., “I am prepared to say by the authority of Jesus Christ”), and so, while the letter seems to have been composed in his own voice, it also seems like elevated, quasi-scriptural discourse compared to less formal communication contained in some other letters. I reasoned that such a composition could provide a useful test of the hypothesis of whether Joseph Smith might be spontaneously and naturally inclined to producing the <em>kinds</em> of repetition that are similar to the structures observed in the Book of Mormon when composing works orally and especially while working in a scripture-like register.</p>

<p>Formatting text containing elements of repetition into putative poetic structures is intrinsically subjective,[^formatting_subjectivity] and others have highlighted the dubious nature of some of these kinds of constructions imposed on Book of Mormon text, particularly Alma 36 (see, for example, <a href="https://www.dialoguejournal.com/articles/critique-of-alma-36-as-an-extended-chiasm/">Wunderli</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRN3Ska_sak&amp;t=6624s">Davis</a>). Freely acknowledging the highly subjective nature of the task, I nonetheless set out to identify parallelistic structures with some basis in the repetition of phrases and themes inherent to one of Joseph Smith’s oral compositions from relatively near in time to his dictation of the Book of Mormon, his January 1833 letter to Noah Saxton, a copy of which was made shortly after its composition and is found in Letterbook 1.[^letter_used_elsewhere]</p>

<pre>
Mr. Editor Sir,


A Considering the <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">Liberal prisciples</span> [principles] upon which your
  interesting and valuable paper is published

    B and myself being <span style="color:orange; font-weight:bold">a subscriber</span>

        C and feeling a deep intrist [interest] in the cause of Zion and in
          the happiness of my brethren of mankind I cheerfully take up my pen to
          contribute my mite at this every <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">[very] interesting and important
          period</span>

            D For some <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">length of time</span>

                E I have been car[e]fully <span style="color:purple; font-weight:bold">viewing the state of things</span> as
                  now appear throug[h]out our christian Land

                    F and have looked at it with <span style="color:magenta; font-weight:bold">feelings of the most painful
                      anxiety</span>

                        G while <span style="color:brown; font-weight:bold">upon the one hand</span>

                            H beholding the manifeste<strike>d</strike> <span style="color:#088F8F; font-weight:bold">withdrawal of Gods
                              holy Spirit</span>

                                I and the <span style="color:#FA8072; font-weight:bold">vail</span> of stupidity

                                I' which seems to be <span style="color:#FA8072; font-weight:bold">drawn</span>

                            H over <span style="color:#088F8F; font-weight:bold">the hearts of the people</span>

                        G' and <span style="color:brown; font-weight:bold">upon the other hand</span>

                    F' beholding <span style="color:magenta; font-weight:bold">the Judgments of God</span> that have swept and
                       are still sweeping hundreds and thousands of our race 
                       (and <span style="color:magenta; font-weight:bold">I fear</span> unprepared) down to the shades of death 

                E' with this <span style="color:purple; font-weight:bold">solemn and alarming fact before me</span> I am led to
                   exclaim [“]O that my head were waters and mine ey[e]s a
                   fountain of tears

            D' that I might weep <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">day and night</span> &amp;c.”

        C' I think that it is <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">high time</span> 

    B' for a christian world to <span style="color:orange; font-weight:bold">awake out of sleep and cry mightely to that
       God</span> day and night

A' whose anger we have <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold">Justly incured</span>.


A Are not these things a sufficient stimulant to <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">arouse the faculties</span>

    B and call forth <span style="color:orange; font-weight:bold">the energies</span> of evry man woman and child that poseses
     <span style="color:orange; font-weight:bold">feeling of sympathy</span> for his fellow[s]

        C or that is in any degree endeared to <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">the bud[d]ing cause of our
          glorious Lord</span>;

            D I leave an inteligent community to answer this important
              question with a confession that this is what has caused me to
              overlook my own inability and <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">expose my weakness to a learned
              world</span>

                E but trusting in that God who has said these things are <span style="color:purple; font-weight:bold">hid
                  from the wise and prudent</span>

                    F and <span style="color:magenta; font-weight:bold">reve[a]led unto babes</span>

                        G I step forth into the field to tell you <span style="color:brown; font-weight:bold">what the
                          Lord is doing and what you must do</span> to enjoy the
                          smiles of your saviour in these last day[s]— 

                            H The <span style="color:#088F8F; font-weight:bold">time has at last <strike>come</strike> arived</span>

                                I when the God of Abraham of Isaac and of
                                  Jacob <span style="color:#FA8072; font-weight:bold">has set</span> his hand again the seccond
                                  time <span style="color:#FA8072; font-weight:bold">to recover the remnants of his people</span>

                                    J which <span style="color:black; font-weight:bold">have been left</span>
                                        from Assyria,
                                        and from Egypt
                                        and from Pathros &amp;.c.
                                        and from the Islands of the sea 

                                    J' and with them <span style="color:black; font-weight:bold">to bring in</span> the fulness
                                       of the Gentiles

                                I' and <span style="color:#FA8072; font-weight:bold">establish that covenant with them</span>

                            H' <span style="color:#088F8F; font-weight:bold">which was promised when their sins should be
                               taken away</span>. (See Romans 11. 25, 26, &amp; 27 and
                               also Jeremiah 31. 31, 32, &amp; 33,)

                        G' This covenant has never been established with the
                           house of Isreal nor with the house of Judah for <span style="color:brown; font-weight:bold">it
                           requires two parties to make a covenant</span> and those
                           two parties must be agreed or no covenant can be
                           made.

                    F' Christ in the days of his flesh <span style="color:magenta; font-weight:bold">proposed to make a
                       covenant with them</span>

                E' but <span style="color:purple; font-weight:bold">they rejected him</span> and his proposals and in
                   consequence thereof they were broken off and no covenant
                   was made with them at that time

            D' but <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">their unbelief has not rendered the promise of God of none
               effect</span>;

        C' no, for there was another day limited in David <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">which was the day of
         his power</span> and then his people Isreal, should be a willing people

    B' and he would <span style="color:orange; font-weight:bold">write his laws in their hearts and print them in their
       thoughts</span> their sins

A' and their eniquities <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">he would remember no more</span>,


A Thus after this chosen family had <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">rejected Christ</span> and his proposals

    B the heralds of salvation said to them “lo <strike>I</strike> we turn unto the gentiles,”
      <span style="color:orange; font-weight:bold">and the gentiles received the covenant</span>

        C and were grafted in from whence <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">the chosen family were broken off</span>

            D but the Gentiles have <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">not continued in the goodness of God</span>

                E but have <span style="color:purple; font-weight:bold">departed from the faith</span>

                    F that was <span style="color:magenta; font-weight:bold">once delivered</span> to the saints 

                    F' and <span style="color:magenta; font-weight:bold">have broken</span> the <strike>everlasting</strike> covenant

                E' <span style="color:purple; font-weight:bold">in which their fathers were established</span> (see Isaiah 24th 5th) 

            D' and have <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">become high minded and have not feared</span> therefore

        C' but few of them will be <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">gathered with the <u>chosen family</u></span>

    B Has not the pride highmindedness and <span style="color:orange; font-weight:bold">unbelief of the Gentiles</span>

A' <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">provoked the holy one of Israel to withdraw his holy spirit</span> from them and
send forth his Judgments to scourge them for their wickedness; 

this is certianly the case, Christ said to his deciples Mark 16, 17 &amp; 18 that

        these signs should follow them that believe;
        In my name shall they cast out Devils 
        they shall speak with new tongues
        they shall take up serpants
        and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them
        they shall lay hands on the sick
        and they shall recover,

        [Exact quotation of Mark 16:17--18 except missing the leading "And"]

and also in connection with this read 1 Corinthians 12 Chapt,


A By the foregoing <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">testamonies</span> or through the glass of the foregoing testamonies

    B we may <span style="color:orange; font-weight:bold">look at the Christian world</span>

        C and see the <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">apostacy</span> there has been

        C' from the <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">Apostolic platform</span>,

    B' and who can <span style="color:orange; font-weight:bold">look at this</span>,

A' <strike>and</strike> and not exclaim in the language of <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">Isaiah</span>,

    [“]the earth is defiled under the inhabitants thereof
    because they have
        transgressed the Laws,
        changed the ordinances
        and broken the <strike>everlasting</strike> covenant”

    [[Isaiah 24:5, KJV: The earth <span style="font-weight:bold">also</span> is defiled under the inhabitants thereof;
    because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance<span style="font-weight:bold">[s]</span>, broken
    the everlasting covenant.]]


A The <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">plain fact</span> is this,

    B the <span style="color:orange; font-weight:bold">power of God</span>

        C begins to <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">fall upon the Nations</span>,

            D and the <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">light of the latter day glory</span>

                E begins to break forth <span style="color:purple; font-weight:bold">through the dark atmosphere</span> of
                  sectarian wickedness

                    F and their iniquity rools <span style="color:magenta; font-weight:bold">[rolls] up into view</span>

                    F' and the Nations of the Gentiles are <span style="color:magenta; font-weight:bold">like the waves of
                       the sea</span>

                E' <span style="color:purple; font-weight:bold">casting up mire and dirt</span> or all in commotion

            D' and they hastily are preparing to <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">act the part allotted them</span>

    B' when <span style="color:orange; font-weight:bold">he shall rule them</span> with a rod of iron &amp; break them in peaces

A' like <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">a potters vessel</span>,


A The Lord has <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">declared to his servants</span> some Eighteen months since

    B that he was then <span style="color:orange; font-weight:bold"> withdrawing his spirit from the earth</span>,

Joseph Smith J<u>r</u>
&lt;/pre&gt;

### Conclusion

Joseph's January 1833 letter contains a generous amount of repetition and it is not particularly difficult to arrange the repetition into chiastic patterns of varying strength. The exercise suggests that Joseph naturally employed repetition, including copious inversions, in at least this one composition.

[^formatting_subjectivity]: I am not a literary expert, but I have studied chiastic structures as an amateur.  For instance, at one time or another I have read most of John (aka Jack) Welch's publications on the topic, and I have read and studied Parry's "The Book of Mormon text Reformatted according to Parallelistic Patterns" more than once. Parry's book is [reviewed here](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1186&amp;context=msr), and a second edition of Parry's work from 2007, entitled "Poetic Parallelisms in the Book of Mormon" may be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20190303092642/https://publications.mi.byu.edu/pdf-control.php/publications/bookchapters/Poetic_Parallelisms_in_the_Book_of_Mormon_The_Complete_Text_/Poetic%20Parallelisms%20in%20the%20Book%20of%20Mormon.pdf).

    Welch has [defined criteria](https://archive.bookofmormoncentral.org/sites/default/files/archive-files/pdf/welch/2019-01-04/john_w._welch_criteria_for_identifying_presence_of_chiasmus_1989.pdf) to measure the strength of a chiastic structure, but nonetheless there is some element of subjectivity in choosing parallels from any text (for instance, consider critiques of the structuring of Alma 36 by [Earl Wunderli](https://www.dialoguejournal.com/articles/critique-of-alma-36-as-an-extended-chiasm/) and [William Davis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRN3Ska_sak&amp;t=6624s)).

    I acknowledge that the emphasis of particular themes among various portions of the text (aka "cherry-picking") grants a formatter some liberty in structuring the text. Still, my efforts do not seem wildly disproportionate to the effort of LDS scholars to tease out chiastic structure among multiple possible inherent structures.

    My proposed phrase/element pairings clearly differ in strength. For instance, some phrases are virtually identical ("upon the one hand" and "upon the other hand") while others possess only modest thematic resonance (e.g., "Look at the Christian world" vs. "look at this", and in some cases the pairings were even more tenuous (i.e., "compatibility" instead of "equivalence") and driven primarily by the drive to couple other similar phrases to produce a satisfying structure overall. The tenuousness of some pairs means it it is possible to construct somewhat different structures from the same text.  Still, most of the structures I identified seem to have some grounding in thematic or phrase repetition that seems intrinsic to the text itself (only a few chiasms seemed especially tenuous on the whole to me).  While the validity of any particular structure and many of the pairings may rightfully be questioned, the fact that significant repetition lends itself to the generation of several putative poetic structures with reasonable coherence seems to be a property _intrinsic_ to Joseph Smith's composition and not a characteristic _completely_ imagined by myself.

[^naturalistic_explanations_for_chiasmus]: I have outlined various potential explanations for how chiastic structure might appear in an early 1800s composition like the Book of Mormon in [this document](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/best-arguments-against-chiasmus-as-evidence-of-ancientness/).  Explanations include: 1) appearance by chance alone; 2) the author somehow gleaned the technique from one or more of the two popular Bible commentaries of that time which described inverted parallelism; 3) the author received commonplace training in rhetorical methods of the time such as anastrophe (inversion); or 4) the structures are a feature of oral composition, as might be predicted by Oral Formulaic Theory.

[^letter_used_elsewhere]: Saxton would only publish the last two paragraphs in [the February 2, 1833 7:6 edition of The American Revivalist and Rochester Observer](http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/NY/miscNYSc.htm). In 1844, the entire letter was published as part of Joseph Smith's History in the Times and Seasons, [vol 5, pg 707](https://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/digital/collection/NCMP1820-1846/id/8337).
