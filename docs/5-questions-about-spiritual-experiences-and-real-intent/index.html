<ol>
  <li>
    <p>When you say you know, what do you really mean?</p>

    <p><em>When I used to say I know, it was that I had a spiritual experience in the context of mormonism.  Reading the Book of Mormon for example or sitting in the celestial room.  So for me, I feel and I trust, would have been better phrases.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do you have real intent in discovering and following truth?</p>

    <p><em>Real intent to believe that the book of mormon is true, no matter what is entirely different than having real intent in discovering and following what is true.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How many religious paths did you honestly and sincerely explore with real intent before you chose to become a mormon?</p>

    <p><em>I never once considered the truth claims of another religion as a mormon.  All the while telling people that I knew it was true.  It was a freaky experience the first time I had a spiritual experience in catholic mass and while meditating in a Buddhist temple.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you have never honestly and with real intent explored other religious truth claims, how do you know with certainty that what you have is  true and what they have is less true?</p>

    <p><em>I have never had a very good answer on this one.  It all comes down to platitudes.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The cynic who will only consider negative evidence to prove the church false clearly does not have real intent in finding the truth.  Why does the faithful mormon who will only consider positive evidence to prove the church true have real intent in finding truth?  Why are they not the same sin on opposite sides of the same coin?</p>

    <p><em>Mormons love to throw critical thinkers under the bus.  You don’t have real intent.  I assume they mean, real intent to just believe.  And I guess they would be right.  But a closed minded cynic is the exact same person as the closed minded faithful person.</em></p>
