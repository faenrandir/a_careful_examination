    <p>Whether to prevaricate or from benign ignorance of the facts, LeGrand Richards denied the existence of the seerstone:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We don’t have a seer stone.  That went back with the plates…</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>(from <a href="http://thoughtsonthingsandstuff.com/the-legrand-richards-interview/">The Legrand Richards Interview</a>)</p>

<p>WALTERS: Well I thought somebody said that Joseph Fielding had Joseph Smith’s seer stone.</p>

<p>RICHARDS: No. We don’t have that.</p>

<p>WALTERS: You don’t have that?</p>

<p>RICHARDS: No.</p>

<p>WALTERS: Oh.</p>

<p>RICHARDS:: We have got some of the early writings of the Prophet Joseph and things of that kind, and testimony of when Joseph Smith performed a plural marriage for them, but – things of that kind in the Historian’s office. But we have [unintelligible] church.</p>

<p>VLACHOS: Is the seer stone in the historical department?</p>

<p>RICHARDS:: We don’t have a seer stone. That went back with the plates when [unintelligible]</p>

<p>WALTERS: Oh! Okay, I hadn’t heard that. I see. I thought that somebody said that it was still out there somewhere.</p>

<p>VLACHOS: Do you know what it looked like?</p>

<p>RICHARDS: What?</p>

<p>VLACHOS: Do you know what the stone looked like?</p>

<p>RICHARDS: No. I’ve never seen it. And I don’t think there is any living man who has seen it.</p>

<p>From the 2015 Salt Lake Tribune article <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150806210326/http://www.sltrib.com/news/2802019-155/mormon-church-to-release-more-documents">“Mormon church releases photos of ‘seer stone’ used by founder Joseph Smith”</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The LDS Church provided a new glimpse of its origins Tuesday by publishing the handwritten “printer’s manuscript” of the Book of Mormon and photos of the “seer stone,” a dark, egg-size polished rock founder Joseph Smith claimed to have used to produce the faith’s sacred scripture.</p>
