<h3 id="the-scriptures-predicted-all-of-this">The scriptures predicted all of this</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>the scriptures predicted all of this</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Most Bible scholars today believe there is abundant evidence from Biblical texts themselves that the early Christians expected Jesus to return in <em>their</em> lifetimes.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/search?q=second+coming&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all">Search AcademicBiblical for “second coming”</a> to see discussions.</li>
  <li>There is abundant evidence that the early LDS Church all believed <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/failed-second-coming-predictions-in-early-lds-church/">the second coming was going to happen in their lifetime</a>.</li>
  <li>Patriarchs have been promising people they would “not taste of death” and “live to see the second coming” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/6rctgu/if_your_patriarchal_blessing_indicates_you_will/">since the Church began</a>.  So many of these people have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/etg6rw/second_coming/">already died</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can track earthquakes around the world (e.g., <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/">here</a>, <a href="https://earthquaketrack.com/recent">here</a>, or <a href="https://www.emsc-csem.org/Earthquake/world/M5/">here</a>).  <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/263105/development-of-the-number-of-earthquakes-worldwide-since-2000/">Same old, same old</a>.</p>

<p>Bill Gates predicted an outbreak like coronavirus <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Af6b_wyiwI">in 2015</a> (and obviously he’s not a scientist, so his prediction is coming from them).  His relatively vague prediction is <em>far more accurate</em> than anything the scriptures or modern prophets say.  Because <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/w/images/5/54/Science.jpg">science works</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the prophet is right</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was the official position of the Church (published in official literature) that you could <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/lds-statements-on-cause-and-cure-for-homosexuality/">pray away your gay</a>.  The gay, atheist, liberal sex researchers figured it out <em>way</em> before the prophet.  Those are the people making accurate predictions about the world, it seems.</p>

<p>Also, compare something like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=health">pubmed</a> with the Word of Wisdom.  Science gives us so much more resolution and accuracy on topics of health and wellbeing than anything spoken over an LDS pulpit.</p>
