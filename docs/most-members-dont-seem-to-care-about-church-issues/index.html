    <p>From <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/6ipikx/after_leaving_the_church_was_anyone_else/">here</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After leaving the church, was anyone else completely shocked to discover that most TBM’s really don’t care about church issues?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Coming from a once completely devout and believing member, one of the biggest shocks came after I read the CES letter and tried to share what I had discovered. While I had my reservations, for the most part I expected my friends and family to be as “mind-blown” and outraged as I was. Come to find they don’t really care, and several have severed ties with me because of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just absolutely crazy and cultish behavior.</p>
