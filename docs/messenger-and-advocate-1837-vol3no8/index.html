<hr />

<p>You may plead former habits, as an extenuation of your guilt, but we ask if the Almighty did not know your habits and the propensities of your nature? Certainly he did. Has he made any exceptions in your case, or are you wiser than he? judge ye.</p>

<p>These, to many, may appear like small items; but to us, any transgression of the commands of God, or a disregard of what he has said, is evincive of a determination to gratify our own corrupt vitiated taste, the word of the Lord to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<p>The Presidents of the Seventies met in council in the House of the Lord, on the 29th of April, 1837, and after opening the meeting by prayer, they proceeded to take into consideration some difficulties, either real or imaginary, existing among the Seventies; aud [and] believing that every elder who is called to proclaim the gospel to the nations of the earth, should in all things conduct himself like a man of God, adopted, among others, the following resolutions:</p>

<p><strong>1st-That we will have no fellowship whatever with any Elder belonging to the quorums of the Seventies who is guilty of polygamy or any offence [offense] of the kind, and who does not in all things conform to the laws of the church contained in the Bible and in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants.</strong></p>

<p>2d.-That we discard the practice of ball-playing, wrestling, jumping and all such low and degrading amusements, and above all the use of ardent spirits of any kind; and will have no fellowship with any member of our quorum who indulges himself in the practice of such things.</p>

<p>3d.-That these resolutions be signed by the chairman and clerk, publicly read on the next Sabbath for the approval of the Seventies, and published in the Messenger and Advocate.</p>

<p>DANIEL S. MILES, Chair.</p>
