<p>[very rough draft]</p>

<h1 id="linguistic-evidence">Linguistic Evidence</h1>

<h2 id="names-in-the-book-of-mormon">Names in the Book of Mormon</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> There are 188 unique names in the Book of Mormon that are not found in the Bible. Many of these names are Hebrew or Egyptian in origin, which is to be expected for a people who emigrated from ancient Jerusalem in 600 B.C.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, we should note that, according to Sandra Tanner, 141 names found in the Book of Mormon <em>are</em> from the Bible. She noted <a href="http://utlm.org/onlineresources/bomnames.htm">some patterns with many of the others</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many names not found in the Bible seem to be made up by re-arranging various syllables or changing the ending of Bible names. For example, the Bible speaks of Abinadab, the Book of Mormon mentions Abinadi and Abinadom.. Smith’s book also uses the Biblical Aminadab and a modified Aminodi. The Bible mentions Kish, the Book of Mormon has Akish and Kishcumen. The Bible has Gimzo, the Book of Mormon speaks of Gimgimno. Besides using the Biblical name Helam, Smith’s book expands it to Helaman. The Book of Mormon uses the Biblical name of Antipas and builds on it to form these Book of Mormon names: Anti-Nephi-Lehi, Antiomno, Antion, Antionah, Antionum, Antiparah and Antipus. Some seem to be simply different spellings. Melech in the Bible becomes Melek in the Book of Mormon. In like manner, Nahum becomes Nahom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More names are created by adding such endings as “hah.” The Book of Mormon has the names Nephi and Nephihah; Moroni and Moronihah; Ammon and Ammonihah; Mathoni and Mathonihah. Some names seem to be just extensions of the same Book of Mormon word. For example, Antion seems to be the base for Antionah, Antionum and Antiomno. Book of Mormon Shim is expanded to Shimnilon. Corianton is slightly changed to make the additional names of Coriantor, Coriantum and Coriantumr. Smith’s book uses the Biblical word Gideon and shortens it to Gid, then expands it to Giddianhi, Giddonah, Gidgiddonah and Gidgiddoni. Riplah seems to be the base for Riplakish and Ripliancum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Others have noted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200206052103/http://lds-mormon.com/names.shtml">potential sources</a> for ~200 Book of Mormon names.</p>

<p>Because there are so many names in the Book of Mormon, and if we allow near matching, then we are bound to run into coincidences of varying strength, just by chance. See the <a href="https://improbability-principle.com/the-laws-of-the-improbability-principle/">Laws of the Improbability Principle</a>. I will list out obvious ways these names could have been derived from the Bible or early 1800s religious milieu. Although this exercise does not diffuse a potential parallel with an ancient name/root, it gives us an alternative model. Randomly made up names would still likely match some of these various roots with varying degrees of rigor just by virtue of being similar to Biblical names, for example.</p>

<p>[Also, need to elaborate and/or cite <a href="https://archive.org/details/NewApproachesToTheBookOfMormon/page/n347/mode/1up">chapter 9, from New Approaches to the BoM</a>, especially Table 1  . Book of Mormon Names Divided into Stems and Affixes. Also, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_code_names_in_the_Doctrine_and_Covenants">List of code names in the D\&amp;C</a> (noticed by TruthIsAntiMormon)]</p>

      <li>The Egyptian King was named Piankhi, not Paanchi. Paanchi itself is a fairly unique name, but it’s not a great match for the Egyptian Piankhi (instead, it sounds more greek with the “chi” ending). Paanchi might be pronounced “pee-ANG-kee,” while Paanchi is closer to “pah-AHN-chee”. The name comes in the midst of a constellation of “Pa-“ names (Pahoran and Pacumeni), and it only requires doubling the “a” and the addition of a new “chi” ending to produce. Other possible inspiration for the Paan beginning is “Pæan”,  another name for Apollo (discussed in lots of books before 1830, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Pantheon_Representing_the_Fabulous_H/B6FhAAAAcAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22paan%22&amp;pg=PA38&amp;printsec=frontcover">here’s one example</a>). “paan” is <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Grammar_of_the_Language_of_the_Lenni_Len/02VkAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=Paan">listed in a grammar of the Delaware Indians</a> published in Philadelphia in 1827.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pahoran – a) great chief judge, b) son of the same.
    <ul>
      <li>Pa-her-an – Ambassador of Egypt in Palestine, where his name has the “Reformed” reading Pahura; in Egyptian as Pa-her-y it means “the Syrian” or Asiatic.</li>
      <li><strong>Similar to Paran (Genesis 21:21)</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pacumeni – Son of Pahoran.
    <ul>
      <li>Pakamen – An Egyptian proper name meaning “blind man”; also Pamenches (Gk. Pachomios), commander of the south and high priest of Horus.</li>
      <li><strong>A combination of other BoM names: Pachus (Alma 62:6) and Cumeni (Alma 56:14)</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pachus – Revolutionary leader and usurper of the throne.
    <ul>
      <li>Pa-ks and Pach-qs – Egyptian proper names. Compare Pa-ches-I, “he is praised.”</li>
      <li><strong>Some mixture of Paulus (Acts 13:7)? Achaicus (1 Cor. 16:17)? Pontus (Acts 2:9)?</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sam – Brother of Nephi.
    <ul>
      <li>Sam Tawi – Egyptian “uniter of the lands,” a title taken by the brother of Nehri upon mounting the throne.</li>
      <li><strong>Joseph Smith had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_H._Smith_%28Latter_Day_Saints%29">a younger brother named Samuel</a> (Sam was a common short form at that time)</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Seezor-am and Zeezr-om – A depraved judge, and a lawyer, resp., the latter also the name of a city.
    <ul>
      <li>Zoser, Zeser, etc. – A third Dynasty ruler, one of the greatest Pharaohs.</li>
      <li><strong>A simple prefix “See” added to “Zoram”.  “Rom is a common root used in BoM names. Zeezrom is similar to Seezoram just with the “o” dropped. Note that Seezoram is also similar to Cezoram (Helaman 5:1)</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Zemna-ri-hah – Robber chief.
    <ul>
      <li>Zmn-ha-re – An Egyptian proper name: the same elements as the above in a different order–a common Egyptian practice.</li>
      <li><strong>Similar to Zemaraim (Joshua 18:22)</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Zeniff – Ruler of Nephite colony.
    <ul>
      <li>Znb, Snb – Very common elements in Egyptian proper names, cf. Senep-ta.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> Most, if not all, of the listed connections were unknown in 1830.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As demonstrated, somewhat who had been steeped in the Bible or from Joseph Smith’s milieu could have constructed the above names by riffing on names he would have read or heard before. The various putative connections to ancient names could easily be a by-product of being somewhat similar to Bible names.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> Nephi – Listed in the table above. John Gee alternately argues that “Nephi” could be derived from the ancient Egyptian “nfr,” meaning “good” or “beautiful”.2 If so, isn’t it interesting that Nephi repeats the theme of “goodness” throughout his writings? That would make a creative triple pun3 in the first verse of the Book of Nephi:</span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> “I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.”</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> How did Joseph Smith create a triple pun in a dead language in the first verse of the Book of Mormon?</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are <a href="https://improbability-principle.com/the-laws-of-the-improbability-principle/">lots of ways to make connections between things</a>, even when they may not have been intentional (i.e., a pattern can be observed but it may not have been intended by the author). For example, it seems that the word Nephi is introduced in the apocrypha as a way to refer to a cleansing (“And Neemias called this thing Naphthar, which is as much as to say, a cleansing: but many men call it Nephi.”) Cleanliness and purity is a dominant theme in both books of Nephi (consider 1 Nephi 10:21 as an example “if ye have sought to do wickedly in the days of your probation, then ye are found unclean before the judgment-seat of God; and no unclean thing can dwell with God; wherefore, ye must be cast off forever”, and similarly 1 Nephi 15:33–34, 1 Nephi 12:10, 1 Nephi 13:37, 1 Nephi 15:36, 2 Nephi 2:9–10, 2 Nephi 9:14, 2 Nephi 9:23, 2 Nephi 13:26, and 2 Nephi 31:5–10). 2 Nephi Chapter 31 is focused on obtaining and keeping a remission of sins and then chapter 33 (the closing of 2 Nephi) ends with some emphasis on cleanliness where Nephi “speaketh harshly against sin” and calls to mind, in his <em>last</em> verse the judgement bar<sup id="fnref:judgement_bar"><a href="#fn:judgement_bar" class="footnote">1</a></sup> (where cleanliness will become paramount!). The connection is even more significant since the word “Nephi” is the last word of the verse in which it appears in the apocrypha!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> Paanchi – As listed in the table above, in Helaman 1, Paanchi is one of the three sons of Pahoran seeking the chief judgeship. Paanchi is the same name as one of the most well-known kings in Egyptian history.4 Paanchi is not mentioned in the Bible. His name and history remained unknown to scholars until the end of the nineteenth century. Hugh Nibley comments that he was a “contemporary of Isaiah and a chief actor in the drama of Egyptian history at a time in which that history was intimately involved in the affairs of Palestine.”5</span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> How did Joseph Smith know about a famous Egyptian king who was unknown to scholars until after Joseph’s death?</span></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>It is not clear that Paanchi is actually a reference (or equivalent to) Piankhi.</li>
  <li>Joseph may have been derived such a name from any number of other sources of inspiration (as discussed above). The LATL question leans on an unsubstantiated assumption (i.e., that Joseph could not have produced such a word as Paanchi without it being sourced from an ancient record).</li>
</ul>

<p>[Currently trying to get an assessment of the strength of this claim from Egyptologists]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni – As listed in the table above. Evidence Central reports that:</span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> “At the beginning of the book of Helaman, readers encounter a confusing cluster of three similar sounding names: two men (a father and a son) named Pahoran, as well as the son’s two brothers Paanchi and Pacumeni (Helaman 1:2–3). Although this constellation of names would be an unlikely choice for a good fiction writer, Hugh Nibley noticed that it rings true for a record written in ‘reformed Egyptian’ (Mormon 9:32–34). ‘A striking coincidence,’ Nibley noted, ‘is the predominance among both Egyptian and Nephite judge names of the prefix Pa-. In late Egyptian, this [prefix] is extremely common.’ Each of the[se] names, and not just the initial pa- (Egyptian pꜢ- = “the”) prefix, bears striking resemblance to Egyptian names.”6 (emphasis added)</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>If Joseph Smith were author, then we do not require him to be a “good fiction writer” and hence he might produce such a cluster of similar names if he is grasping for new names during dictation. In addition, we might expect any number of these kinds of coincidences by chance (see <a href="https://improbability-principle.com/the-laws-of-the-improbability-principle/">the improbability principle</a>).</p>

<p>Alma was a common male name in Joseph Smith’s vicinity, as demonstrated <a href="https://discussmormonism.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=26">here</a> and discussed on <a href="https://radiofreemormon.org/2020/12/mormonism-live-004-the-rise-and-fall-of-alma-the-apologetic/">this Mormonism Live podcast episode</a>.</p>

  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> Sariah - Critics mocked Joseph for naming Lehi’s wife Sariah, which was understood at the time to be an ancient male Hebrew name. That is until the name Sariah appeared on papyri in the Egyptian Jewish community of Elephantine, dating to around 500 BC for two women.10</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not aware of the evidence suggesting that “Sariah” was understood to be a male name in or around 1830. The name (as spelled) is <em>not</em> in the Bible (as mentioned above), so it would require a person to be aware that words spelled somewhat differently were in fact necessarily equivalent (how aware of this was Joseph Smith?). Furthermore, when Chadwick first publishes the finding of Sariah (śry) as a female name <a href="https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1056&amp;context=jbms">in 1993</a>, he only notes that “The skeptic <strong>might</strong> suggest that this name was an invention of Joseph Smith, since Sariah does not appear in the Bible as a female personal name.” (emphasis added). So the basis for the surprise/tension behind this point seems more imagined than real/demonstrated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> How did Joseph Smith know that Israelite women from Egypt also carried the name of Sariah around the same time as Sariah in the Book of Mormon? Wouldn’t Joseph’s only source for Sariah (Seraiah) have been men in the Old Testament?</span></p>

<p>The question implies that JS could only have derived such a name via an ancient record, but since Sariah is a very simple riff on the name Sarai, and Sarai was a significant character in the Bible, then something like that could have been the source.</p>

  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> Jershon – In Alma 27:22, the Nephites give the converted Anti-Nephi-Lehites a piece of land in their territory. “This land Jershon is the land which we give unto our brethren for an inheritance.” (emphasis added) How interesting is it that the word “Jershon” is likely Hebrew for “place of inheritance”?11 Doesn’t this make a creative play on words in the Book of Mormon? How familiar was Joseph Smith with ancient Hebrew in 1829?</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Jershon” is similar to the name “Gershon” in the Bible (Genesis 46:11). Interestingly, Gershon is mentioned in the same chapter and general context of Jacob/Israel going down and inheriting a new land (for them), Egypt (see 46:4–11).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> Update: Critics harp on “mistakes” in the Book of Mormon until researchers find evidence to support its ancient origins. As more ancient linguistic connections are uncovered, critics rarely credit the Book of Mormon. Instead, they seem to double down on the increasingly shorter list of “mistakes” in the Book of Mormon.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We expect that as more is discovered about the ancient world (and as BYU researchers trawl through that information looking for connections), then we expect that these kinds of parallels would occur by chance (basically, there are more possible things to hit as that knowledge base grows so more things could hit at random). The fact that some of the “mistakes” are not adequately resolved is exactly what the naturalist model might predict for a modern BoM. Remaining “mistakes” are the only way for researchers to determine a book is modern that is trying to assert it is of ancient origin. One can read into motivations whatever they like, but a dispassionate view of the data would necessarily be drawn towards the remaining “mistakes” since they potentially hold the key of situating the book with modern authorship.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That may be true (although Thompson does not substantiate the claim [can’t currently login to archive.org to verify whether Nibley substantiates this]). However, a separate strain of thought viewed the structures in the Americas as having been influenced <em>by</em> the Egyptians, so the author of the BoM may have been writing etiologically—how does one explain the Egyptian influence in the Americas? Examples of this strain of thought can be seen in Barbara Simon’s 1829 Hope of Israel, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Hope_of_Israel/SSY7AAAAYAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22This%20tradition%22&amp;pg=PA110&amp;printsec=frontcover">pg 110</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> Scholars are still learning about Egypt’s cultural influence in Israel during Lehi’s day.13 Artifacts with Egyptian characters dating back to that period show the widespread usage of Egyptian in Israel.

</blockquote>

<p>I’m not aware of any substantiation for the idea that people were mocking Joseph Smith for this [need to validate it’s not in Lehi in the Desert]. And, as I’ve demonstrated, there was interest, among some at least, for finding connections between Israel and Egypt in the manifestations seen in the Americas (e.g., pyramid architecture).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> On the surface, an uninspired Joseph Smith would have likely suspected that Hebrew was the language of Lehi.

<p>This is a great control experiment that certainly weakens somewhat the demonstration of how the characters in the Caractors document seem to merely be modified English characters. What has not been explored here is the ease with which one or the other is capable of being transformed into English. (i.e., it may still be the case that turning the characters in the Caractors document is easier than with other languages). But noone has systematically performed that kind of (admittedly difficult) analysis.</p>

<p>Also, to characterize an argument as “deceptive” suggests the author knows that the people making the argument <em>knowingly realized</em> that this could be done with other alphabets and chose to withhold or inappropriately downplay that information. I do not think this has been demonstrated.</p>

  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> Critics may find it uncomfortable that many characters in the Caractors document have ancient origins.

</blockquote>

<p>I do not find this uncomfortable at all. Showing that a relatively minor subset of characters are similar to characters in ancient Egyptian is interesting but not by itself conclusive. How frequently do these characters match (or nearly match) characters in any other given language? This would give us a baseline by which to judge the significance of these similarities. To be sure, we expect some fraction of characters made up at random to match (or nearly match) ancient characters—at random—because there are only so many kinds of very distinct strokes and marks one can make for characters.</p>

<p>In 1956, letters from an exchange with an Egyptologist were published in the Saints’ Herald, the RLDS Magazine. In it, the Egyptologist <a href="https://www.academia.edu/31894670/1956_Statements_of_Egyptologists_on_the_Caractors_Document">analyzed the Caractors document</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1.) This is not Egyptian writing, as known to the Egyptologist. It obviously is not hieroglyphic, nor the “cursive hieroglyphic” as used in the Book Of the Dead. It is not Coptic, which took over Greek characters to write Egyptian. Nor does it belong to one of the cursive stages of ancient Egyptian writing: hieratic, abnormal hieratic, or demotic.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>2.) The writing purports to be a kind of cursive, as if copied from a writing with pen on papyrus. However, it fails to conform to the normal pattern of cursive writings, in which the pen remains on the papyrus, to join together individual characters into groups, such as syllsbles or words. The ers in this specimen stand suspiciously separated from each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>3.) I have not subjected the specimen to an association analysis, to determine if certain individual characters show an affinity for other characters, as our English q- regularly is followed by -u, as our words “the, this, that, there, then” tend to form a recognizable pattern. I did check three characters (A,B,C) on the copy and found that their associates were suspiciously varied. In any regular context, as in our Bible, personal names and common nouns will recur in a kind of pattern. That kind of pattern is not visible here.</p>

<p>I think Stubbs’s work is interesting, but it seems far from conclusive to me.

The problem is that Shakespeare had passed away over 100 years earlier. Theobald’s claim was nearly impossible to prove. Most skeptics believed Lewis Theobald made up the claim to bolster ticket sales. Some believed that Shakespeare and John Fletcher co-wrote the play (they had written a couple of plays together early in Shakespeare’s career). Unfortunately, the original manuscript was destroyed in a fire. Without the original handwriting, no one could prove the authorship. Until recently, most believed the Double Falsehood was a Theobald production. Then in 2015, researchers from the University of Texas leveraged computing power to solve the mystery. Using a sophisticated computer model, they analyzed Shakespeare’s, Theobald’s, and Fletcher’s language, style, and voice. From this, they could create a psychological signature for each author. The model could determine who wrote Double Falsehood.19 They determined that Shakespeare likely authored the first three acts—the final two being authored by Flecher.

However, there are other authors quoted. Sometimes, these quotes are lengthy sections or whole chapters. These voices include Jacob, Alma, Abinadi, Nephi (son of Helaman), and Jesus Christ. John’s research shows a wide range of variety from the different authors of the Book of Mormon. Also, the linguistic fingerprints of the Book of Mormon authors are distinct from Joseph Smith’s voice in his other writings. 19th-century authors, on the other hand, have limited voice diversity between different characters in their books.21 Even characters that differ from others in the same book written by typical 19th-century authors usually cluster around a specific range of voice diversity.</span></p>

<p>The book is mostly modular, and there are only a few main characters who are given a significant voice.

This is not a skill limited to authors.</p>

  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> While the voice diversity is impressive, John Hilton also identifies the layers of intertextuality within the Book of Mormon, which adds to its complexity. For example, when Alma was teaching his son Corianton (Alma 39-42), he quoted Abinadi’s teachings and phrases hundreds of pages earlier (from Mosiah 12-13) that applied to Corianton’s concerns.25</span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> How did Joseph Smith create a book with so many layers of complexity and intertextuality?26 With his limited education, in less than 90 days, in one draft, with no manuscripts to consult, off the top of his head, no less?</span></p>

<p>It’s difficult to comment on this since I’m not going to buy a ~$28 book in order to evaluate the contents (if someone sends me a copy then I will evaluate it in depth).</p>

<p>In general, the Book of Mormon is fairly modular in creation. The relatively few references from one part of the text to another can be explained by Joseph remembering memorable aspects of what he had dictated earlier, or perhaps because he had been going through the growing manuscript itself. Nothing prevented him from examining the manuscript and there is evidence that he and Oliver were consulting the growing manuscript <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/metcalfe-joseph-and-oliver-consulted-manuscript/">in at least on instance</a>.</p>

In all, there are 1204 instances of “wayehi” in the Hebrew bible. The Old Testament and Book of Mormon use “and it came to pass” in the more narrative sections. The more literary parts lack that phrase.</span></p>

<p>The answer, from the naturalistic perspective, is embedded in the context of the question. The phrase “and it came to pass” is used extensively in the Bible, too. A person who was very familiar with the Bible[^familiar_with_the_bible] and is orally dictating<sup id="fnref:oral_dictation"><a href="#fn:oral_dictation" class="footnote">2</a></sup> is very likely to fall back on “filler” kinds of phrases in order to maintain flow.

Linguist Royal Skousen first identified if-and conditionals in the original version and printer’s manuscript of the Book of Mormon.

In Hebrew this same idea is expressed in another manner: ‘if you come, and I will come.’ This structure makes perfect sense in Hebrew but is not found in English. When Joseph Smith translated 1 Nephi 17꞉50, he dictated ‘if he should command me that I should say unto this water be thou earth, and it shall be earth.’ This non-English construction was removed from this verse by Oliver Cowdery as he copied the original manuscript to produce the printer’s manuscript. He deleted the word and, making the text read better in English. The sentence now reads: ‘if he should …, it should be earth.’”31 (emphasis added)</span></p>

  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> How did Joseph Smith pick up on this ancient Hebrew literary if-and conditional when it is not correct English? A one-off could have been a grammatical error, but fifteen instances?</span></p>

<h3 id="chiasmus">Chiasmus</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> “Chiasmus” was a popular literary device in ancient languages like Greek, Latin, and Hebrew.32 It is a type of poetic inverted parallelism. Its existence in the Book of Mormon demonstrates a high level of sophistication by Hebrew writers. Chiasmus was not consciously used in American writing until the 1850s. John Welch was the first scholar to identify chiasmus in the Book of Mormon in 1967.33 There are dozens of chiasmi in the Book of Mormon, though not every one may be deliberate. A statistical analysis from Edwards and Edwards demonstrates that the chiasmus in Alma 36, Mosiah 3:18-19, Mosiah 5:10-12, and Helaman 9:6-11 were likely created by thoughtful design.34</span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> Here is the chiasmus in Alma 36 as it came from Joseph Smith’s lips. Its beauty and complexity make it nearly impossible to believe he made it up on the fly. Note that Jesus Christ is the center of Alma’s redemption story. (Source: Alma 36 Chiasm by Book of Mormon Central)</span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> Isn’t Alma 36 a stunning demonstration of redemption and the power of Christ’s atonement?</span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> How did Joseph Smith come up with Alma 36 and other chiasmus in the Book of Mormon off the top of his head with zero experience in ancient Hebrew literary forms?</span></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> Further, Allen Christenson found that chiasmus abounds in sixteen out of thirty-seven late Mayan texts written shortly after the Spanish conquest in the sixteenth century. Chiasmus is especially prevalent in Mayan historical and religious passages.35 None of the highland Mayan documents composed after 1580 include chiasmus passages.</span></p>

  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> Are Hebraisms a bullseye for the Book of Mormon? Not quite. Nevertheless, aren’t they at least interesting? Worth exploring?</span></p>

<h2 id="book-of-mormon--linguistic-evidence-conclusion">Book of Mormon | Linguistic Evidence Conclusion</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> The further along my faith journey I traveled, the less comfortable I was with critical explanations for the Book of Mormon. I marveled at the critic’s conspiracy theory-like reconstruction of how Joseph Smith created the Book of Mormon. When I mentally recreated the critic’s narrative, I felt like I was left with a scenario more unbelievable than an angel simply giving golden plates to Joseph. Then, as I learned more about the linguistic connections between ancient languages and the Book of Mormon, I was even more baffled by the book. While linguistic evidence for the Book of Mormon was not enough on its own to convince me of the truth claims of the restoration, I was starting to feel unsettled as a potential atheist.</span></p>
