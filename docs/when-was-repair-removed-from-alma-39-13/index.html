    <p>The assertion has made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/9fky8z/new_leaked_document_eli5/">in a leaked document</a> related to the Mickelson case that “repair” was removed from the 1981 version of the BoM by LDS leadership in order to grant sex abuse perps a pass in making restitution.  If we examine various editions of the BoM, we can see that they are mistaken: the word <a href="https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865576118/BYU-professor-Royal-Skousen-concludes-his-discussion-on-changes-to-the-Book-of-Mormon-original-text.html">was in the original handwritten manuscript</a> but it was mistakenly shifted to “retain”, which makes little sense with the verse.  “retain” was used from 1830 until 1879.  In 1921, “retain” was removed.  “repair” has never been used in any official printing, so it can’t have been removed in some kind of consipiracy.</p>

<hr />

<p>1829 that ye turn to the Lord with all your mind, might, and strength, that ye lead away the hearts of no more to do wickedly, but rather return unto them and acknowledge your faults and <strong>repair</strong> that wrong which ye have done.</p>

<p>1830 that ye turn to the Lord with all your mind, might and strength; that ye lead away the hearts of no more, to do wickedly; but rather return unto them, and acknowledge your faults, and <strong>retain</strong> that wrong which ye have done;</p>

<p>1837 that ye turn to the Lord with all your mind, might and strength: that ye lead away the hearts of no more, to do wickedly; but rather return unto them, and acknowledge your faults, and <strong>retain</strong> that wrong which ye have done;</p>

<p>1840 that ye turn to the Lord with all your mind, might and strength; that ye lead away the hearts of no more, to do wickedly; but rather return unto them, and acknowledge your faults, and <strong>retain</strong> that wrong which ye have done;</p>

<p>1879 That ye turn to the Lord with all your mind, might and strength; that ye lead away the hearts of no more, to do wickedly; but rather return unto them, and acknowledge your faults, and <strong>retain</strong> that wrong which ye have done;</p>

<p>1921 That ye turn to the Lord with all your mind, might, and strength; that ye lead away the learts of no more to do wickedly; but rather return unto them, and acknowledge your faults and <strong>[removed]</strong> that wrong which ye have done.</p>

<p>1981 That ye turn to the Lord with all your mind, might, and strength; that ye lead away the hearts of no more to do wickedly; but rather return unto them, and acknowledge your faults and <strong>[removed]</strong> that wrong which ye have done.</p>

<p>1992 That ye turn to the Lord with all your mind, might, and strength; that ye lead away the hearts of no more to do wickedly; but rather return unto them, and acknowledge your faults and <strong>[removed]</strong> that wrong which ye have done.</p>

<p>The recent changing of its repentance doctrine is evidenced in the changing repentance scriptures . Unbeknownst to the general body of the church , in 1981 the leaders began changing the Book of Mormon . One of these notable changes to the Book of Mormon’s repentance model occurs in Alma 39:13, wherein the pre-1981 passage reads :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… acknowledge your faults and repair that wrong that ye have done .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The post - 1981 version omitted the word repair .</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… acknowledge your faults and that wrong that ye have done .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this change to scripture , the sinner or aggressor simply needs to acknowledge what has happened , with no requirement to address the restoring or reparation aspect to the aggression . This would explain the new double standard in LDS disciplinary actions: One .  ( easier ) standard for the leaders and their elite cronies (i . e . if you can convince the victims with DC 64:10 to unconditionally forgive your assailant — and provide a written letter to prove it ); and a completely different and much stricter standard for the rank and file members ( who are disfellowshipped for masturbating) . And , depending on your source , there are anywhere from 600 to 3 , 000 such changes to the Book of Mormon . That does not include the covert changes in the Doctrine &amp; Covenant and the Pearl of Great Price . If one can covertly change scripture , one can easily change and control doctrine . Note: Elder Mickelsen and Elder Scott were the two men in charge of translating / interpreting the new LDS Spanish Bible . Coming full circle : Where and how do hidden Letters of Forgiveness enter into the doctrinal equation?</p>
