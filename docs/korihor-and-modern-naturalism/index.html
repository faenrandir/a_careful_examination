  <div class="post-content">
    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Latter-day Saints sometimes invoke Korihor (Alma 30) as a scriptural prototype of the modern secular or scientific critic. The implication is that the Book of Mormon has already answered contemporary skepticism by depicting and refuting it in narrative form. I would like to suggest a more modest claim: <strong>Korihor does not closely resemble the strongest versions of modern naturalism</strong>, and therefore the chapter may not directly address the kind of skepticism many thoughtful people actually hold today.</p>

<p>My purpose is not to defend Korihor. The text clearly presents him as arrogant, rhetorically harsh, and morally careless. Rather, the question is whether he is an adequate representative of what might be called a <em>measured skeptical position</em>—one that is cautious, evidence-sensitive, and morally serious.</p>

<h2 id="1-dogmatic-denial-vs-epistemic-restraint">1. Dogmatic Denial vs. Epistemic Restraint</h2>

<p>Korihor does not merely express doubt; he makes sweeping negations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“There should be no Christ.”</li>
  <li>“No man can know of things which are to come.”</li>
  <li>“There is no God.”</li>
</ul>

<p>These are strong metaphysical assertions. By contrast, many contemporary skeptics adopt a more restrained stance. Instead of asserting nonexistence, they commonly say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The available evidence does not justify belief in these claims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This difference matters. There is a meaningful gap between confident denial and suspended belief. Korihor’s rhetoric places him in the former category. Modern naturalism, at least in its more careful forms, often occupies the latter.</p>

<p>Alma’s rebuttal, therefore, engages a figure who speaks with certainty about what cannot be known. That does not necessarily address someone who is simply unconvinced.</p>

<h2 id="2-prophecy-and-the-question-of-evidence">2. Prophecy and the Question of Evidence</h2>

<p>Korihor dismisses prophecy outright. Yet humans clearly can anticipate future events in many ordinary ways. A more focused skeptical concern would not be whether prediction exists, but whether specific prophetic claims meet clear standards of verification.</p>

<p>Questions a modern inquirer might raise include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How do we distinguish precise prophecy from broad or symbolic language?</li>
  <li>How do we guard against retroactive reinterpretation?</li>
  <li>What criteria would count as decisive confirmation?</li>
</ul>

<p>These are methodological questions rather than blanket denials. They do not assume prophecy is impossible; they ask how it can be reliably identified.</p>

<p>Korihor’s categorical language simplifies the issue, making it easier to rebut than a more careful evidentiary challenge would be.</p>

<h2 id="3-religious-experience">3. Religious Experience</h2>

<p>Korihor characterizes spiritual assurance as mental derangement. That dismissal does not represent most contemporary secular thinking. Many naturalists acknowledge the depth and transformative power of religious experience while questioning whether such experiences establish specific metaphysical conclusions.</p>

<p>In other words, one can affirm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The sincerity and psychological reality of spiritual experience,</li>
</ul>

<p>without affirming:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The objective truth of every theological interpretation attached to it.</li>
</ul>

<p>This distinction allows space for respect without agreement. Korihor does not draw that distinction, and the narrative responds to a more extreme dismissal than many skeptics would endorse.</p>

<h2 id="4-morality-and-accountability">4. Morality and Accountability</h2>

<p>One of the most consequential portrayals in Alma 30 is Korihor’s apparent moral relativism—“whatsoever a man did was no crime.” This depiction suggests that disbelief leads naturally to moral collapse.</p>

<p>Yet many modern secular thinkers maintain robust moral commitments grounded in human well-being, reciprocity, and the recognition that conscious beings can flourish or suffer. They would reject the idea that disbelief entails ethical indifference.</p>

<p>The narrative may rightly critique moral irresponsibility, but it does not engage the strongest forms of secular moral reasoning. As a result, it risks conflating skepticism with nihilism.</p>

<h2 id="5-motives-and-sincerity">5. Motives and Sincerity</h2>

<p>Korihor accuses religious leaders of manipulating the people for gain. Alma responds by emphasizing his own unpaid service. This exchange highlights an important point: sincerity matters.</p>

<p>A more careful critique of religion need not assume bad motives. It is possible to believe that religious leaders are fully sincere while still questioning whether their beliefs are true. Sincerity and accuracy are not identical.</p>

<p>Korihor’s attack on motives weakens his credibility and simplifies the debate. A measured skeptic would focus on claims and evidence rather than on alleged manipulation.</p>

<h2 id="6-signs-and-epistemic-standards">6. Signs and Epistemic Standards</h2>

<p>When Korihor requests a sign, Alma responds that sufficient witnesses already exist: scripture, testimony, and the order of creation. Within the narrative, the subsequent miracle resolves the dispute.</p>

<p>For modern readers, however, the deeper question concerns epistemic standards. What kinds of evidence should reasonably persuade someone about metaphysical claims? How do we evaluate competing interpretations of the same world?</p>

<p>These are ongoing philosophical questions. Alma 30 addresses them within a revealed framework, but readers outside that framework may still find the underlying epistemic issues open.</p>

<h2 id="7-the-narrative-resolution-and-sincere-doubt">7. The Narrative Resolution and Sincere Doubt</h2>

<p>Korihor’s final confession reframes his disbelief as morally compromised rather than merely mistaken. The story thus emphasizes the spiritual danger of willful rejection.</p>

<p>For believers, this underscores accountability. For others, it raises a different question: Is there space for sincere, good-faith doubt within the narrative? Many contemporary nonbelievers do not see themselves as rebellious or malicious, but as unconvinced.</p>

<p>Recognizing this difference in self-understanding is important for productive dialogue.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The central question raised here is not whether Korihor is right—he is plainly not presented as such—but whether he represents the strongest form of contemporary skepticism. His dogmatic assertions, moral reductionism, and rhetorical excess make him an easily refutable figure. Yet modern naturalism, at its most thoughtful, is characterized less by denial than by evidentiary caution and proportional belief.</p>

<p>If Alma 30 is read as a response to arrogance and corrosive relativism, its critique is direct and forceful. If it is read as a comprehensive rebuttal of modern secular inquiry, the correspondence becomes less exact. The measured skeptic does not insist that nothing divine exists; he or she asks what justifies confident metaphysical claims.</p>

<p>Clarifying this distinction may sharpen both faith and doubt. It prevents believers from answering a weaker version of skepticism while overlooking stronger forms, and it invites skeptics to engage religious claims at their most thoughtful rather than their most vulnerable.</p>
