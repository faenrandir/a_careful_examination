    <p>I share many basic beliefs with the conscientious, moral citizens of our world.</p>

<h2 id="the-universal-moral-code">The Universal Moral Code</h2>

<p>I believe in the Universal Moral Code which is a list of morals found throughout the world, compiled by Dr. Kent M. Keith.</p>

<p><strong>Do no harm</strong> (the proscriptive version of the code):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not do to others what you would not like them to do to you.</li>
  <li>Do not lie.</li>
  <li>Do not steal.</li>
  <li>Do not cheat.</li>
  <li>Do not falsely accuse others.</li>
  <li>Do not commit adultery.</li>
  <li>Do not commit incest.</li>
  <li>Do not physically or verbally abuse others.</li>
  <li>Do not murder.</li>
  <li>Do not destroy the natural environment upon which all life depends.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Do good</strong> (the prescriptive version of the code):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do to others what you would like them to do to you.</li>
  <li>Be honest and fair.</li>
  <li>Be generous.</li>
  <li>Be faithful to your family and friends.</li>
  <li>Take care of your children when they are young.</li>
  <li>Take care of your parents when they are old.</li>
  <li>Take care of those who cannot take care of themselves.</li>
  <li>Be kind to strangers.</li>
  <li>Respect all life.</li>
  <li>Protect the natural environment upon which all life depends.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-6-pillars-of-self-esteem">The 6 Pillars of Self-Esteem</h2>

<p>I believe in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007JK9BAY/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">6 pillars of self-esteem</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Living consciously — “When we live consciously we do not imagine that our feelings are an infallible guide to truth.”</li>
  <li>Self-acceptance — “Accepting, compassionate interest does not encourage undesired behavior, rather it reduces the likelihood of it recurring.”</li>
  <li>Self-responsibility — “There is no one coming to our rescue, individually or collectively; no one is going to save us.”</li>
  <li>Self-assertiveness — “unleashing our personality, intellectual abilities, talents, etc., whether other people, including family members and friends, like it or not”</li>
  <li>Living purposefully — “we have the right to establish goals for ourselves based on what we think and feel is right and good”</li>
  <li>Personal integrity — “It takes courage to act with integrity to the truth, particularly one’s inner truth that others may dislike, negatively judge, and even condemn.”</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="ip-mans-wing-chun-jo-fen">Ip Man’s Wing Chun Jo Fen</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Remain disciplined — uphold yourself ethically as a martial artist</li>
  <li>Practice courtesy and righteousness — serve the community and honor your family</li>
  <li>Love Your classmates — enjoy working together as a group</li>
  <li>Control your desire — stay healthy</li>
  <li>Work hard and keep practicing — never let the skill leave your body</li>
  <li>Learn to develop spiritual tranquility — abstain from arguments and fights</li>
  <li>Always deal with world matters with a kind attitude that is calm and gentle.</li>
  <li>Help the weak and the very young — use your martial skill for the good of humanity</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-5-pillars-of-islam-modified">The 5 Pillars of Islam (modified)</h2>

<h2 id="main-tenets-of-zoroastrianism">Main tenets of Zoroastrianism</h2>

<p>I believe in the <a href="https://zoroastrians.net/2008/09/16/chief-principles-of-our-zoroastrian-religion/">main tenets of Zoroastrianism</a>, in slightly modified form:</p>

  extent they share in personhood).</li>
  <li>Our speech should generally be sweet and beneficial.</li>
