  <div class="post-content">
    <p>The family I grew up in was highly faithful to the Church way of life (not perfect, of course, but actively striving).  A few examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We either woke up early for family scripture study or my mom would read scriptures to us at the table growing up fairly regularly.</li>
  <li>We regularly held family home evening (probably &gt; 75% of the time).</li>
  <li>We typically watched every session of conference.</li>
  <li>Our family invited people over for missionary discussions growing up.  I helped to convert a friend to the faith when I was in high school, and one of my younger brothers converted his friend.</li>
  <li>Every one of the many children in my family graduated from BYU.</li>
  <li>Every one of the many boys in my family served to completion an LDS mission (and all were effective and diligent as far as I am aware).</li>
  <li>We never watched TV on Sunday.</li>
  <li>My mom always told us stories about forgoing social activities to attend sparsely attended Church activities.</li>
  <li>My mom always told us about how my older brother was thirsty after his game but all they were serving was Coke, so he just went thirsty.</li>
  <li>My grandparents served many missions and also served as a mission president.  My grandmother served a mission.  My parents served a mission immediately upon retirement and are currently serving as service missionaries.</li>
</ul>
