    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The first two examples below were shared by Bill Davis on December 20 and 21 of 2021.</p>

<p>Bill discussed the Alma 10:51 example in some depth.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Amulek: “I never have known much of the ways of the Lord, and his mysteries and marvelous power. I said I never had known much of these things; but behold, I mistake, for I have seen much of his mysteries and his marvelous power”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Did you catch that?  The switch from Amulek saying “I never had known” to saying “I mistake, for I have seen.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s not a honing or restatement of meaning, but rather a complete reversal from the first claim to the second claim.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>That’s what happens when the mouth is running faster than the mind (we all have that problem now and again, right?).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But this is important to note: This isn’t the type of mistake that a person makes who is engraving words on a metal plate.  It’s a lot of extra and unnecessary words, and a lot of extra work.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This also isn’t the type of mistake that a person leaves in a text, when revising the draft of a work.  In other words, it’s not “refined” (mechanically or, for that matter, stylistically).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is, however, the type of mistake and immediate self-correction and oral revision that occurs in spoken (dictated) scenarios.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>What this tells us:  When Joseph Smith dictated the Book of Mormon, he was involved in the process as an active contributor to the language of the text.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="alma-1051-i-mistake">Alma 10:51 “I mistake”</h2>

<p><em>Amulek</em>: “…I never have known much of the ways of the Lord, and his mysteries and marvelous power.</p>

<p><em>[pause; recognition that a mistake was made]</em></p>

<p>I said I never had known much of these things; but behold, I <strong>mistake</strong>, for I <strong><em>have</em></strong> seen much of his mysteries and his marvelous power …”</p>

<h2 id="alma-526-truly-he-was-preparing">Alma 52:6 “truly he was preparing”</h2>

<p>But he [Teancum] kept his men round about, <strong><em>as if</em></strong> making preparations for war [pretending];</p>

<p><em>[pause; decision to revise]</em></p>

<p>yea, and <strong><em>truly he was</em></strong> preparing [not pretending] to defend himself against
them, by casting up walls round about and preparing places of resort.</p>

<h2 id="alma-2419-buried-their-weapons-of-peace">Alma 24:19 “buried their weapons of peace”<sup id="fnref:couch"><a href="#fn:couch" class="footnote">1</a></sup></h2>

<p>… and thus we see that they buried their <strong><em>weapons of peace</em></strong>,</p>

<p><em>[revise]</em></p>

<p>or they buried <strong><em>the weapons of war, for peace</em></strong>.</p>
