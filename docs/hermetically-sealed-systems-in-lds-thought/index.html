<p>A hermetic seal is one which is entirely airtight (see an example of a hermetically sealed vial to the right). A hermetically sealed system of thought is, by analogy, one which is cutoff from, or virtually impervious to, outside ways of thinking.<sup id="fnref:hermetically_sealed"><a href="#fn:hermetically_sealed" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<div style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 0px: margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
    <img style="margin: 0px" src="../media/hermetically_sealed_neon_gas.png" alt="A vial of hermetically sealed neon gas">

</div>

<p>I propose that a hermetically sealed system of thought may be created when a person accepts one or more assumptions (sometimes unawares) which then prevent them from ever arriving at conclusions outside the resulting system of thought.  From <em>within</em> the system it appears that the full range of choices and possibilities are available, but the thought structure (constrainted by the adoption of certain assumptions or premises) makes some conclusions impossible (or at least difficult) to access.</p>

<p>Hermetically sealed systems of thought, as described in this document, may be viewed as a subset of the greater <a href="/a_careful_examination/lds-indoctrination-and-retentive-socialization/">socializing influence of the LDS Church and its culture</a> which by some measure discourages members from exploring alternative approaches or worldviews. Alternatively, the systems of thought I diagram below may be viewed as a yet unprobed/untested variant of psychological phenomena that might influence a person’s choices, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_%28psychology%29">framing effects</a>.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#structure-veracity-and-agency" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Structure, Veracity, and Agency</h2>

<p>These diagrams say nothing (directly) about how well these systems of thought coincide with reality.  However, examining the systems of thought in this form may make it easier for the reader to determine if the systems are veridical (i.e., coincide with reality). And, regardless of whether these systems of thought are veridical, their structure may demonstrate aspects of LDS thought which may inhibit members and investigators from exploring the full latitude of thought as they consider alternative models in approaching LDS truth claims.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Somewhere along the way Matt said, “Dad, why did we feel, after praying about it, that the right road was the proper one to take, the correct one to take, and it wasn’t?” I think that the Lord, his wish for us there, and his answer to our prayer, was to get us on the right road as quickly as possible with some reassurance, with some understanding that we were on the right road and we didn’t have to worry about it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Among the Latter-day Saints, the preaching of false doctrines disguised as truths of the gospel, may be expected from people of two classes, and practically from these only; they are:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>First—The hopelessly ignorant, whose lack of intelligence is due to their indolence and sloth, who make but feeble effort, if indeed any at all, to better themselves by reading and study; those who are afflicted with a dread disease that may develop into an incurable malady—laziness.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Second—The proud and self-vaunting ones, who read by the lamp of their own conceit; who interpret by rules of their own contriving; who have become a law unto themselves, and so pose as the sole judges of their own doings. More dangerously ignorant than the first.</p>

<p>A common interpretation (taught in the Scotland, Edinburgh mission

also read and study the Bible because otherwise how can they ponder on
how God has dealt with the children of men from the creation of Adam

<blockquote>
  <p>Recently I had an engaging conversation with a young man
who was contemplating a mission. As we talked, it became apparent that
he was struggling with his decision, because he was questioning the
strength of his testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. He wanted to
know why he had not received more clear answers to his prayers and
study of the scriptures.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>…First, we must have a sincere desire to believe. Phrases such as
“awake,” “arouse your faculties,” “experiment,” and “exercise a
particle of faith” are action words that suggest sustained effort on
our part.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>…To my young friend, and to all wherever you may be, never give up
on the Lord. The answer to your prayers may not be as clear or as
timely as you would like, but keep praying.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've gone to church the last two Sundays and I think it's fantastic.
I really like a lot of the ideals of the church. I'm already living
by the word of wisdom, and I'm following the commandments, and
reading the scriptures, and I'm praying. I keep waiting for an
answer, anything. But I'm not getting a thing. <em>The missionaries say
to keep praying, and to pray with more specific questions</em>, but no
matter what I try I'm just not getting any answers.</p>

<p>Or,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you keep trying, things will only get better. Keep pushing forward
and remember; the amount of effort you give is more important than the
amount of success…. Don't stop praying and have patience.</p>

  <p>I can remember sitting in the back row of the chapel as
the instructor began teaching about the Prophet Joseph Smith. I’ll
never forget it. It was a riveting moment of clarity. I was completely
tuned in to the story. As it culminated and the teacher bore
testimony, I knew that I knew it was true. I just knew it. But more
importantly, I realized that I’d always known it was true; this was
just the first time I’d realized it.</p>

Heavenly Father could tell me, too. I didn’t expect a vision, but I
believed God would somehow let me know if this was His Church. I
decided that as soon as the testimony meeting ended, I would go a
little ways from the lodge among the trees to kneel and pray as Joseph
had.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>During the meeting, I listened intently to the
testimonies, and I recognized that the Spirit was very strong. My
sister’s friend stood to bear his testimony. As he said the words, “I
know the Church is true and that God lives,” I heard a still, small
voice whisper within me: “You know it’s true, too. You’ve always
known.” Tears filled my eyes because I knew God had heard my prayer
before I had even spoken it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After reading the Book of Mormon, I knelt in prayer. I had a great
desire to know of its truth. I hoped it was true, knowing what joy
this would bring me. That night I prayed for hours desiring to know.
The following nights I continued in my prayers and began to wonder if
I would receive a witness.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>My determination in waiting for a witness was a trial of my faith.
After many days I came to the realization that I knew the Book of
Mormon was true. It came not as a sign or a voice. I knew because in
the center of my being I could not deny that it was true. I also knew
that God existed and that he is my Heavenly Father, that Jesus Christ
is the only begotten son of God.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This came to me, not as new knowledge, but as a peaceful remembrance
of that which I already knew. I did not need a further witness. I had
always known the truth. My pride in my own knowledge had caused me to
forget my testimony.</p>

<p>“<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/new-era/1999/02/is-it-true?lang=eng">Is It True?</a>” New Era, Feb 1999.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I had already read the Book of Mormon several times, both with my
family and on my own. Every time I read it, I would pray to know if
the words I received were true. I never felt like I received a firm
answer to those prayers, and over time I grew more and more
discouraged. I was afraid that not receiving that witness meant that
the Church wasn’t true.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But I was determined to try again. I began reading the Book of Mormon
again, studying and pondering it as I had never done before. Near the
end of the fall semester at college, I finished the Book of Mormon. I
sat on my bed and thought a lot about how I should go about asking
again. Tears flowed down my cheeks as the fear of not being answered
crept over me. I prayed to Heavenly Father and told Him how I was on
my own now and needed a witness that the Book of Mormon was true. At
the end of my prayer I waited and waited, but once again, no answer
came. I felt a deep weakening in my heart, and I cried because once
again my prayers seemed to have failed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The next morning I attended my religion class. My teacher began to
talk about prayer. In the course of his lecture he said, “Don’t ask
the Lord a question you already know the answer to.” I immediately
felt the Spirit, and three words entered my mind, “You already know.”
I realized that I already knew that the Church and the Book of Mormon
were true. My mind filled with thoughts of how I knew it was true. I
thought about the joy the gospel had brought into my life. I thought
of the peace and happiness that I always felt when I was living the
commandments. I thought of the many times I had felt the Spirit.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now if I get discouraged as I work to build a testimony of my own, I
remember the joy the gospel has brought me throughout my life. I
remember the times I have felt the Spirit. And I don’t discount the
subtle reassurances I have felt of the gospel’s truth.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As seekers of truth, our safety lies in asking the right
questions, in faith, and of the right sources—meaning those who only
speak truth: such as the scriptures, prophets, and the Lord through
the Holy Ghost.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are basically two different ways we can approach our questions.
For our purposes here, we’ll distinguish between these approaches by
labeling them <em>questioning</em> and <em>asking questions.</em> When it comes to
matters of faith, there can be a pretty big difference between the
two. The difference has to do with how and why you’re asking the
questions, what you hope to gain from them, and where they’ll
eventually lead you.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Questioning,</em> here, refers to challenging, disputing, or picking
something apart. When it comes to religion, the result of this
approach is often not to find answers but rather to find fault and
destroy confidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the other hand, in religion, just as in science or anything else
worth studying, it’s absolutely essential to <em>ask questions,</em> even
difficult ones. It’s the only way you’ll get answers. And answers mean
greater knowledge and understanding—and in the case of religion,
greater faith and spirituality.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, your attitude and your motive in asking a question can make all
the difference in where it will eventually lead you. For instance, if
you’re studying the scriptures and come across a passage that seems to
contradict a Church teaching or a scientific or historical fact,
there’s a big difference between asking “How could the scriptures (or
the Church) possibly be true if … ?” and asking “What’s the full
context of this passage and what does it mean in light of … ?” The
first question may lead you to a hastily drawn conclusion based on
skepticism and doubt rather than actual knowledge or logic, whereas
the second is more likely to lead you to greater insight and faith.</p>

  <p>… I have tried multiple times to describe in writing that <em>how</em> we
ask questions about our faith is more important than the questions
themselves. … Instead of forcing a conflict between Joseph Smith’s
calling as prophet and the modern translation of ancient texts, a
better set of questions might include things like “If we assume modern
translations of the papyrus are correct, what can we learn about how
Joseph Smith received revelation?” or “What does Joseph Smith’s
experience in trying to translate teach me about revelation for
myself?” or “What can I learn about my assumptions based on this

<a class="anchor" href="#appendix-1---examples-from-other-groups" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Appendix 1 - Examples from other groups</h3>

<p>Some examples from other totalistic groups are easy to identity and show similarities with some LDS hermetically sealed thought. The following are two examples from the Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>

<h4 id="example-1-do-not-communicate-with-former-jws">Example 1: do not communicate with former JWs</h4>

<p><strong>Assumed</strong>: To love God means to entirely avoid communication with a former Jehovah’s Witness.</p>

<p><strong>Innaccessible</strong>: Exposure to criticism from former Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…should we listen to apostates, read their literature, or examine their Web sites on the Internet? If we love God and the truth, we will not do so. We should not allow apostates into our homes or even greet them, for such actions would make us ‘sharers in their wicked works.’ (2 John 9-11) (source)</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="example-2-will-miss-the-good-if-you-focus-on-the-bad">Example 2: will miss the good if you focus on the bad</h4>

<p><strong>Assumed</strong>: You will miss the good and only see bad if you focus on the flaws of the organization or leaders.</p>

<p><strong>Innaccessible</strong>: Aspects of the organization or the actions or teachings of some leaders may be ethically deficient but may be un-observable if one only focuses on the good.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every person in this organization–every one of Jehovah’s Witnesses including the governing body–we’re all imperfect and thus we are subject to making mistakes. Which means that if you look hard enough, all you will see instead of seeing these amazing things that Jehovah is accomplishing and our tremendous privilege of being part of it, all we are going to see is the errors of men. But when we focus on the good, on the guidance and loving support that we’ve received, aren’t we moved with appreciation to cleave to this body of fellow worshipers. And just look at what Jehovah is accomplishing by means of his imperfect servants. There is no other organization on earth providing spiritual food like the one that we belong to. When we look at all of this, how could we possibly let the failings of just a few people undermine this overwhelming proof of Jehova’s backing? (From the 2016 “Remain Loyal To Jehovah” regional convention)</p>

<h3 id="appendix-2---potential-criticisms">
<a class="anchor" href="#appendix-2---potential-criticisms" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Appendix 2 - Potential Criticisms</h3>

<p>I have encountered some criticism of this work in public discussion and can imagine other potential criticism. I will present the criticism and then some thoughts on its validity.</p>

<h4 id="the-diagrams-are-too-reductive">The diagrams are too reductive.</h4>

<p>One might argue that LDS thought allows for the contemplation of the inaccessible thoughts in other ways or contained in other leader statements not represented here.</p>

<p><strong>Response</strong>: There is some validity to this concern. A more complete analysis might assemble <em>every</em> statement (or some large sampling) made by leaders or in lesson manuals on a topic and examine the frequency of a particular logical path in all the relevant statements. A single example cannot demonstrate the <em>predominance</em> of such a thought-pattern, only that such a routing exists and has been employed in official LDS material in at least one instance.  I have made an effort to include patterns that seem dominant (or frequent) to my mind, but without demonstration a person may easily argue that it does not represent the sum of the data or of <em>their</em> personal experience.<sup id="fnref:retentive_socialization"><a href="#fn:retentive_socialization" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h4 id="no-guarantee-of-inaccessibility">No guarantee of inaccessibility</h4>

<p>The explicit enumeration of choices by itself does not guarantee the inaccessibility of the outside conclusion.</p>

<p><strong>Response</strong>: Because LDS thought extends beyond any individual statement and the realm of philosophical thought broadly construed can be viewed as superseding LDS theology or doctrine narrowly defined, that will always be true. Still, when the explicit enumeration of choices does not include a particular possibility, it seems reasonable that a member is then required to shoulder the burden of injecting, mentally constructing, or borrowing such a possibility on their own, and this may not reliably occur and arguably requires more effort to summon.  In any case, it seems reasonable to assume that a person is likely to spontaneously produce alternatives less frequently in instances where the alternative is not enumerated.</p>

<h4 id="every-system-of-thought-is-hermetically-sealed">Every system of thought is hermetically sealed</h4>

<p>It may be argued that all systems of thought are hermetically sealed in some fashion.<sup id="fnref:riskas"><a href="#fn:riskas" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Response</strong>: In 1931 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems">Kurt Gödel demonstrated</a> that to some extent, all logical systems contain one or more true statements which are inaccessible from within that system and the system itself cannot demonstrate its own consistency. Such is the case, for instance, with the scientific method (e.g., the scientific method is incapable of demonstrating that the method itself is valid—demonstrations of that kind lie outside the scientific method). Further, many domains which we typically acknowledge as conveying intrinsic value still suffer from foundational instabilities.<sup id="fnref:psychology"><a href="#fn:psychology" class="footnote">4</a></sup> In some sense, then, demonstrating which statements are inaccessible from within a system of thought does not, by itself, demonstrate the system invalid. Regardless, it still seems reasonable to think that examination of inaccessible (or at least difficult to access) statements may be a fruitful exercise and differences in topology between systems may mean some are more or less open to scrutiny or more or less prone to circularities than alternatives.</p>

<h4 id="brainwashing-is-not-scientific">“Brainwashing” is not scientific</h4>

<p>One might argue that discussing thought patterns in this form is similar to counter-cult research seeking to demonstrate “mind-control” (which ultimately has been of dubious value), and most of these ideas have a tenuous relationship (at best) with mainstream psychological research.</p>

<p><strong>Response</strong>: Significant endeavors that seem somewhat similar to cataloging hermetically sealed systems generally include Robert J. Lifton’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_Reform_and_the_Psychology_of_Totalism">Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism</a>, the DIMPAC report (which was dismissed by the American Psychological Association), Steven Hassan’s BITE model (outlined in <a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/2476570146/">his dissertation</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352552519300118?via%3Dihub">applied in one peer reviewed article</a>) and more generally the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought-terminating_clich%C3%A9">the thought-terminating cliche</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoctrination">indoctrination</a> (or socialization), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">linguistic relativity</a>. Some of these ideas have been rejected by mainstream scientists (e.g., the DIMPAC report) and many others are under-developed academically (e.g., indoctrination, thought-terminating cliche), or lack widespread academic adoption (e.g., the BITE model).<sup id="fnref:luna_lindsey_corbden"><a href="#fn:luna_lindsey_corbden" class="footnote">5</a></sup> I am aware of some of the controversies with the work and frameworks listed above and have argued in favor of academically mainstream approaches (e.g., my argument <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/asking-if-its-a-cult-is-wrong-question/">against using the BITE model to label the LDS Church a “cult”</a> and <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/lds-indoctrination-and-retentive-socialization/">dismissal of the idea of “brainwashing” in favor of a social learning framework</a>).</p>

<p>Regardless, exploration of hermetically sealed systems of thought seems to be at home among legitimate psychological research demonstrating, for instance, the human propensity to be swayed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_%28psychology%29">framing effects</a>.</p>

      <p>As indicated, a hermetic seal was originally used to describe a physical phenomenon. The term “hermetically sealed” appears to have been used somewhat abstractly at least by the early 1800s (e.g., <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Prison_Lucubrations_or_Letters_from_that/zHpjAAAAcAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22hermetically+sealed%22&amp;pg=PA4&amp;printsec=frontcover">pg 4 of this 1808 book</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/No_III/o55KAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22hermetically+sealed%22&amp;pg=PA73&amp;printsec=frontcover">criticized in this 1816 Irish publication</a>.

In very broad stroke, one can argue that the consequences for leaving a religion is typically <a href="https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/consequences-of-leaving-the-group-and-totalism/">proportional to the level of totalism of the group</a>. <a href="#fnref:retentive_socialization" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p>
