    <p>In <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=2625144390851853&amp;set=a.236681833031466">this facebook post</a>, Dr. Julie Hanks suggested that these are things NOT to say to your believing family members after leaving the Church (even if you believe them to be true):</p>

<ol>
  <li>You’re being lied to.</li>
  <li>I just don’t know how you still believe.</li>
  <li>You HAVE to read the CES letter.</li>
  <li>How can you still go to a Church given what’s said in the Church essays?</li>
  <li>How can you justify belonging to a corrupted organization?</li>
  <li>I used to think the way you do. Now I see things clearly.</li>
  <li>When are you going to start thinking for yourself?</li>
  <li>Do you know how much the General Authorities get paid?</li>
  <li>Did you hear about the recently leaked videos?</li>
  <li>I left because I didn’t want my kids to be brainwashed.</li>
  <li>I feel so sorry for you.</li>
  <li>How can you stay in such a sexist organization?</li>
  <li>What you’re saying is a logical fallacy.</li>
  <li>Jesus wouldn’t want anything to do with the Church today.</li>
  <li>If you knew what I knew about Joseph Smith…</li>
  <li>I can’t respect you if you believe in the Church.</li>
  <li>You’re complicit in every hurtful thing the Church does.</li>
  <li>Do you know where all of your tithing goes?</li>
  <li>Believing in God is like believing in Santa Claus, the tooth fairy, etc.</li>
  <li>How can you keep your name on the rolls of an evil institution that hurts so many people?</li>
  <li>Think of how many people the Church could have helped instead of investing so much in real estate.</li>
  <li>If you really loved me, you’d listen to all of my concerns.</li>
  <li>I can’t see how someone as smart as you can be fooled by such crazy beliefs.</li>
  <li>You believe in the because it’s easier than questioning and studying.</li>
  <li>Religion is the opiate of the masses.</li>
</ol>
