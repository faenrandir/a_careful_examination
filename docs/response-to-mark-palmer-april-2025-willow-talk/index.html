    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YygKh4dIsXw">Elder Mark S. Palmer’s April 2025 General Conference talk</a> was addressed to those who have stepped away from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In many ways, the talk is beautiful—marked by compassion and a sincere spirit of invitation. Through metaphor and anecdote, Elder Palmer seeks to offer hope and spiritual renewal to those considering a return. At the same time, his framing—though pastorally delivered—reflects institutional assumptions about what it means to be “rooted,” “lost,” or “healed.” In a spirit of respectful engagement, this response affirms the talk’s sincerity while offering counterpoints drawn from the experiences of many former members, including alternative understandings of spiritual growth, belonging, and the ethical and conscientious reasons people leave the LDS faith.</p>

<h3 id="response">Response</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>We once lived in a home surrounded by majestic trees. Next to the entrance was a beautiful willow tree. One sad night, a mighty storm blew, and the willow came crashing down. It lay on the ground with its roots pulled out, and it was a sorry sight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This analogy implies that a person is only truly rooted if they are active members of the LDS Church and perhaps implicitly that lack of strength or engaging in proper spiritual maintenance caused the person to become weak and thus succumb (i.e., become unrooted) when facing the storms of life.</p>

<p>I prefer to view former members not as spiritually <em>fallen</em>, but as trees that <em>overcame</em> the storms by anchoring deeply into truth and goodness. Our lives may not look the same as members, and we may be rooted in different kinds of soil, but most of us do not think of ourselves as “fallen.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was ready to rev up the chainsaw and cut the tree up for firewood when our neighbor came running out to stop me. He chastised me for giving up on the tree and emphatically urged us not to get rid of it. He then pointed to one root still in the ground and said that if we propped the tree up, cut off its branches, and nourished it, the roots would take hold once again.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was skeptical and doubted how a tree so obviously fallen and in trouble could possibly survive and come back to life. I reasoned that even if it did begin growing again, it would surely not survive the next storm. But, knowing our neighbor believed the tree still had a future, we went along with the plan.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And the result? After some time, we saw signs of life as the tree began to take root. Now, 12 years later, the tree is vibrant and full of life, with strong roots and once again contributing to the beauty of the landscape.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, I meet Saints around the world, I am reminded of this willow tree and how there is hope even when all seems lost. Some once had testimonies of the gospel that were strong and vibrant like the willow. Then, for uniquely personal reasons, those testimonies became weakened, leading to a loss of faith. Others hang on with the slimmest of roots, tapping into gospel soil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The presentation is fairly non-judgemental, but it’s easy to view the framing “strong and vibrant” to “weakened” relative to one’s belief in the LDS institution as a proxy for a former member’s developmental journey. But perhaps the reasons many left the LDS Church did not stem not from weakness but from conscientious wrestling with history, conscience, or ethics. For many, a journey out of the LDS Church is a <em>step</em> in their development, as suggested by Jared Halverson (<a href="https://faithmatters.org/dont-let-a-good-faith-crisis-go-to-waste-jared-halverson/">don’t let a good faith crisis go to waste</a>) and by Thomas Wirthlin McConkie in his book (“Faith Crisis: A developmental map”, <a href="https://exponentii.org/blog/faith-crisis-a-developmental-map-and-an-impromptu-book-review/">reviewed on the Exponent II blog</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yet again and again, I’m inspired by the stories of so many who have chosen to renew their discipleship and come back to their church home. Rather than discarding their faith and belief like worthless firewood, they’ve responded to spiritual promptings and loving invitations to return.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The phrasing “like worthless firewood” might suggest to some that members who leave did so callously and without much thought. My experience has been that many of those who leave appreciate the heritage of faith they had in the LDS faith in various ways. And many of them wrestled deeply with those beliefs before <em>carefully</em> deciding what it is they felt they should discard and what they ought to retain among those beliefs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I attended a stake conference in Korea where returning members shared:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I thank the brothers for their willingness to accept my lack of faith and my weakness, for reaching out to me, and for the members who are always so kind to me. I still have a lot of friends around me who are less active. It’s funny, but they tell each other to go back to the Church to get their faith back. I think maybe they are all longing for faith.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, to all who are longing for faith—we invite you to come back. I promise your faith can be strengthened as you once again worship with the Saints.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you for the invitation. I invite practicing members to learn about why people leave and what they often find afterward. Many former members live deeply meaningful, spiritually rich lives that honor truth as they understand it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A former missionary from Africa wrote a senior Church leader, apologizing and seeking forgiveness for being offended by his teachings about a certain cultural tradition, which then led him to leave the Church. He humbly expressed:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Sadly, the fact that I took offense 15 years ago has made me pay an extremely heavy price. I lost so much—much more than I ever imagined. I am deeply embarrassed by the harm I may have caused along the way. But above all else, I am pleased that I have found my way back.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>While I respect this brother’s journey, most stories of those leaving are not ultimately about people taking offense (especially when viewed in totality). And his particular journey (i.e., paying a heavy price, losing so much, and causing harm he is embarrassed by) does not reflect the journey that many who leave the LDS Church experience. While it is challenging and there are losses, most stand by their decision to leave and feel like it was the best way to prevent additional harm they feel they might have caused were they to have stayed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, to all who recognize what you have lost, we invite you to come back so you can once again taste the joyous fruit of the gospel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you for the invitation. I invite LDS members to seek to understand their friends and neighbors’ journeys to better understand the way they are finding joy and meaning in their lives that, to them, parallels (or sometimes exceeds from their POV) what they found during their time as members.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A sister in the United States was gone from the Church for many years. Her story of coming back includes powerful lessons for parents and family members who anguish over loved ones who step away. She wrote:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I could list a myriad of reasons for why I walked away from the Church, the gospel, and in a way, my family. But they really don’t matter. I didn’t make one big decision to leave the Church. I probably made a thousand choices.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>But one thing I have always known is that my parents did make one big decision—and they stuck to it. They decided to love me. I couldn’t possibly know how many tears have been shed, how many sleepless nights, nor how many heartfelt pleading words of prayer have been uttered on my behalf.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>They didn’t call me out on my sins. Rather, they called out to me in my sinfulness.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>This sister has every right to frame her story as she experienced it. However, one might infer from hearing this story that former members left because of, or are otherwise mired in, “sinful” activities. Since they are not members, most former members don’t view the same kinds of activities as “sins” if they even use such a framework at all for deciding how to live lives of goodness and truth. Most former members I know were no more nor less “sinful” on average than current members. And though they often experiment with various activities that might be frowned on within the LDS structure as part of exploring their post-LDS world, most of them are ultimately quite thoughtful in how they go about doing that (trying to avoid harm and help others along the way).</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>They didn’t make me feel unwelcome in their home and at family gatherings—any of those feelings were of my own doing. Instead, they continued to welcome me.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m happy that she was met with such welcome—so many members are full of and express so much love to everyone. However, one might infer from her description that a person who has left the LDS Church never had any genuine experiences where they were not made to feel welcome (i.e., it was strictly “of [their] own doing.”). Even if many members are welcoming, perhaps this is not always the case?</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>They must have seen my light dim over time, but they knew that the person I was back then was just a shadow of who I was yet to become.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I appreciate what this journey meant to this sister who eventually returned to the Church. One might infer from her story that other former members intrinsically sense their “light dim[ming] over time”, but I don’t think that is the case (even though hardship and sadness are part of everyone’s journey). The former members I know talk about various kinds of growth and spiritual progression after leaving. And many former members share stories where they were in the company of members and someone remarked on how much light they had in their eyes, not realizing that the person had left the LDS Church months or years before (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/ty00tg/the_light_of_christ_in_my_eyes/">for example</a>). In addition, like members in their journey, perhaps some former members at times are carrying “hidden sorrow that the eye can’t see”. Also, how much do our personal <em>expectations</em> and <em>assumptions</em> modulate the light we see in others? Perhaps what a member interprets as a dimming light says more about <em>their</em> view of a former member than the light of that former member?</p>

<p>I’ve just seen so many examples of former members radiating love and joy and serving others in countless ways (not typically in front of members, though). I hope that members will try to see that light.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Just as my path away from the Church was complex, so was my way back. But one thing that was not hard about coming back was a feeling of being back home, where I belong.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now, my message today is especially to all who once felt the Spirit but question whether there is a way back or a place for you in the restored Church of Jesus Christ. It’s also for any who are barely hanging on or who are tempted to step away.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This message is not a challenge, and it’s not a condemnation. It’s an invitation—extended with love and a sincere desire to welcome you back to your spiritual home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I appreciate the heartfelt invitation. Also, the invitation seems to be dictating to us what it is that we <em>actually</em> feel in our hearts: I do not feel that the LDS Church <em>is</em> my spiritual home, even though I honor its place in my growth and spiritual development and have (mostly) warm feelings towards it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have prayed that you will feel the witness of the Holy Ghost as you now hear this loving invitation and magnificent promise from our Savior Jesus Christ:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Will ye not now return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you?</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I honor that many feel healed by their relationship with Jesus and that following Jesus is profoundly inspiring for most LDS members and many non-LDS Christians. Also, many who leave the LDS Church feel like they <strong>are</strong> following Jesus in their lives. And many of us who do not think that Jesus was a divine figure but nonetheless was inspirational in many ways, feel like we are living after the <em>spirit</em> of Jesus of Nazareth by breaking from the traditional religion of our youth in some or many ways in order to—for us—better serve and love the people around us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every week, many are responding to the Savior’s invitation by returning to discipleship and Church activity, quietly and humbly seeking the healing that Jesus promises.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every week, many members are also quietly and humbly <em>leaving</em> the LDS Church, responding to a call to live after goodness and truth according to the dictates of their own conscience.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And, contrary to narratives which sometimes circulate, record numbers of our young people are choosing to stay strong and to grow their faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This may be true, and the LDS Church is welcome to publicly release those numbers any time they wish. Until then, the sociologists who track LDS membership suggest that in the last decade or so the LDS Church has been experience large losses, resulting in <a href="https://religionnews.com/2024/04/12/mormonism-is-still-growing-but-slowly/">a signficant slowdown in growth</a> in places like the US and Europe.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When some of Jesus’ followers in Capernaum found His teachings hard and chose to leave, He turned to His apostles and asked:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Will ye also go away?”</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the question we each must answer as we face our individual times of testing. Peter’s response to Jesus is timeless and resounding:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“To whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life.”</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>From within the LDS Church worldview, these words suggest that only within the LDS institution can a person find the “words of eternal life.” Many former members are following Jesus in other ways, and (from their POV) are seeking truth and goodness in a manner that (we think) would make Jesus of Nazareth quite proud. We view these kinds of invitations through a different lens.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, as you consider the Savior’s invitation to return unto Him, what might you learn from the story of the willow tree?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>1. <strong>The journey back is often not easy or comfortable—but it is worth it.</strong><br />
   When our willow was stood back up, all its branches were cut away. It was not pretty. We too may feel vulnerable as we discard old ways and are stripped of pride. But focusing your faith on Jesus Christ and His gospel—the trunk and the roots—will give you the hope and the courage to take that first step back.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“stripped of pride” suggests that members who leave do so, ultimately, for prideful reasons. Most former members I know describe exercising significant levels of humility to <em>leave</em> the Church they once loved at the risk of losing precious relationships and as the anchor to their life that they had once enjoyed. Of course returning to the Church after leaving would require humility, but persisting in trying to build a life of goodness and truth outside of the institution may require similar levels of (unseen) humility?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2. <strong>It took many years for our willow to regain its former strength and beauty.</strong><br />
   Now, it is even stronger and more beautiful than before. Be patient as your faith and testimony also grow. This includes not taking offense at thoughtless comments like, “Where have you been all these years?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This reminder also could be read to imply that former members are especially prone to taking offense compared to active LDS members. That remains undemonstrated as far as I am aware.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3. <strong>The willow would never have survived without constant care and nourishment.</strong><br />
   You will nourish your faith and your testimony as you feast at the sacrament table each week and as you worship in the house of the Lord.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Members who leave the LDS Church survive and find nourishment in different ways.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4. Just as <strong>the willow needed sunshine for its branches and leaves to grow again</strong>, so your testimony will grow as you stay sensitive to the feelings and the witness of the Spirit. Learn from Amulek, who described his time as a less active member by saying: “I was called many times and I would not hear.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most former members view Amulek as a fictional character whose experience does not reflect their own.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>5. <strong>My neighbor knew what the willow could once again become.</strong> So too, the Lord knows your divine potential and what your faith and your testimony can become. He will never give up on you. Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, all that is broken can be healed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Former members do not view themselves as broken but as normal humans trying to do the best they can.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I witness that there is rejoicing in heaven over those who return.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I appreciate your witness. I am happy when anyone makes a decision to live a life of goodness and integrity, regardless of their religious affiliation, in or out of the LDS Church.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are needed, and you are loved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel needed and loved in many places, and you are also needed and loved by those living rich lives <em>outside</em> of the LDS insitution. There are arguably <em>more</em> service opportunities outside of the LDS institution than within it (just thinking about the many lives that don’t brush up against the LDS institution directly), even if those opportunities don’t always come in the same kind of packaging.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I testify that Jesus Christ is our Savior, and that He blesses all who return unto Him with greater peace and with great joy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You and many members may feel greater peace and joy inside the LDS institution, and I honor that. However, most former members I know describe feeling equal or greater peace and joy <em>outside</em> of the LDS Church, and I choose to honor their own assessment, too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>His arms of mercy are not folded, but are open and extended to you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Acknowledging that we’ll disagree on soteriology, I personally think that Jesus of Nazareth does not especially care which church a person attends (or not) so long as they are striving to serve and watch out for “the least of these” in their lives. And my experience has been that former members are doing that with similar thoughtfulness and persistence as members.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s not too late for you to come back.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you, but I am happy living a life of integrity and goodness outside of the LDS Church. My circle of friendship and love encompass everyone, including LDS members. I would say that it’s not too late for members that are not yet doing so to live in such a way that they are developing and nurturing deep, loving, meaningful relationships without any regard to a person’s LDS membership status. Regardless of our religious persuasionss, I think this is the “stuff” of life worth cultivating.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With all the love in our hearts, we welcome you home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you for the heartfelt welcome. While the LDS Church is no longer the place I personally call home, I have found a deep sense of belonging and purpose among diverse communities of goodwill—both within and beyond religious boundaries. My hope is that we can each continue to build lives of meaning and service, wherever we feel most at home.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Elder Palmer’s message is clearly heartfelt and reflects a sincere desire for reconnection. For many, such invitations offer comfort and renewed spiritual orientation, and I honor those who feel drawn to return to the LDS Church as a result. At the same time, for those of us who have stepped away after deep study and sincere reflection, the metaphors and narratives in this talk may feel prescriptive or misaligned with our lived experience. Still, there is much good to be done in the world, and my hope is that we can come to better understand one another—and work together in the spirit of compassion to help make the world a more just, kind, and beautiful place.</p>
