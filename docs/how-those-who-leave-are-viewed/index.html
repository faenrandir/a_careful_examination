    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>LDS scripture, leaders, lesson manuals, and other material published by the Church speak extensively about those who leave the Church and apostasize (leaving the Church is synonymous with apostasy).  Collectively, these writings emphasize that those who leave the Church are one or more of the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Morally weak (i.e., are sinning)</li>
  <li>Followers of Satan (explicitly or unawares)</li>
  <li>Prone to taking offense</li>
  <li>Too lazy to maintain their spirituality</li>
  <li>Ignorant and/or misinformed about the teachings of the Church.</li>
</ol>

<p>Given this characterization of those who leave, it is not surprising that many feel a need to “defend their actions”, “disprove” the Church, or end up becoming hostile enemies: a person who determines that the Church is not true—regardless of how pure or noble their motives, the strength of their character, the level of their spirituality, or how comprehensively they understand the Gospel—cannot leave with their reputation and character intact.  If they leave without explanation, then it is assumed that they are deficient in character or understanding—if they attempt to exonerate themselves, then they have a “need to defend their actions” or “disprove the Church” and are considered “bitter”.</p>

<p>While a member might be inclined to believe that the “bitter fruits of apostasy” are the natural consequence of turning from the one true faith, virtually <em>all</em> totalistic groups <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdTWTeTkPn0">characterize those who leave in a similar negative light</a> (see additional examples from <a href="http://www.jwstruggle.com/2013/03/the-apostate-boogeyman/">Jehovah’s Witnesses</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPol_m8wm8Y&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m27s">Scientology</a>.  In addition, see “<a href="https://mormonbandwagon.com/bwv549/three-fold-nature-lds-church-corporate-totalistic-individual-growth/">The three-fold nature of the LDS Church: corporate, totalistic, and individual-growth</a>” for a longer discussion of the totalistic mindset and how it is manifest in the LDS Church.

<p>As suggested by the LDS scriptural canon, <em>Individuals who leave the LDS Church…</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>12 But, behold, my beloved brethren, thus came the voice of the Son unto me, saying: After ye have repented of your sins, and witnessed unto the Father that ye are willing to keep my commandments, by the baptism of water, and have received the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost, and can speak with a new tongue, yea, even with the tongue of angels, and after this should deny me, it would have been better for you that ye had not known me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>23 And now behold I say unto you, that if this people, who have received so many blessings from the hand of the Lord, should transgress contrary to the light and knowledge which they do have, I say unto you that if this be the case, that if they should fall into transgression, it would be far more tolerable for the Lamanites than for them.</p>
</blockquote>

  <p>37 Light and truth forsake that evil one.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>38 Every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning; and God having redeemed man from the fall, men became again, in their infant state, innocent before God.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>39 And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, <strong>through disobedience</strong>, from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers. (emphasis added)</p>

<h3 id="are-servants-of-sin-and-children-of-disobedience">are servants of sin and children of disobedience</h3>

<p>Most of those who leave the LDS Church over truth-claim issues are at least implying the possibility that Joseph Smith was being deceitful about his translation abilities (e.g., <a href="https://www.lds.org/topics/translation-and-historicity-of-the-book-of-abraham?lang=eng">with the Book of Abraham</a>) and that the manner in which he implemented polygamy is ethically problematic—for example, lying about polygamy publicly, performing duplicate ceremonies to hide first sealings from his wife, proposing to a seven month pregnant newlywed woman, and marrying a 14 year old who was reluctant to do so (see <a href="https://mormonbandwagon.com/bwv549/five-key-facts/">five key facts for credible references</a>).  Doctrine and Covenants 121 suggests these individuals are the “servants of sin” and “children of disobedience” themselves:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>11 And they who do charge thee with transgression, their hope shall be blasted, and their prospects shall melt away as the hoar frost melteth before the burning rays of the rising sun;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>12 And also that God hath set his hand and seal to change the times and seasons, and to blind their minds, that they may not understand his marvelous workings; that he may prove them also and take them in their own craftiness;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>13 Also because their hearts are corrupted, and the things which they are willing to bring upon others, and love to have others suffer, may come upon themselves to the very uttermost;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>14 That they may be disappointed also, and their hopes may be cut off;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>15 And not many years hence, that they and their posterity shall be swept from under heaven, saith God, that not one of them is left to stand by the wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>16 Cursed are all those that shall lift up the heel against mine anointed, saith the Lord, and cry they have sinned when they have not sinned before me, saith the Lord, but have done that which was meet in mine eyes, and which I commanded them.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>17 But <strong>those who cry transgression do it because they are the servants of sin, and are the children of disobedience themselves</strong>. (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="may-not-have-forgiveness-of-sins-here-or-in-the-world-to-come">may not have forgiveness of sins here or in the world to come</h3>

<p>Many men who leave the LDS Church do so after receiving the Melchizedek Priesthood:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>40 Therefore, all those who receive the priesthood, receive this oath and covenant of my Father, which he cannot break, neither can it be moved.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>41 But whoso breaketh this covenant after he hath received it, and altogether turneth therefrom, shall not have forgiveness of sins in this world nor in the world to come.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.40-41">Doctrine and Covenants 84:40–41</a></p>

<h3 id="may-be-fools-or-traitors">may be fools or traitors</h3>

<p>Doctrine and Covenants 122 (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.1-3">verses 1–3</a>) emphasizes that those who express contempt or ridicule Joseph Smith are fools and traitors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1 The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy name, and <strong>fools shall have thee in derision</strong>, and hell shall rage against thee; (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>2 While the pure in heart, and the wise, and the noble, and the virtuous, shall seek counsel, and authority, and blessings constantly from under thy hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>3 And thy people shall never be turned against thee <strong>by the testimony of traitors</strong>. (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="positive-or-neutral-statements-about-those-who-leave">Positive or neutral statements about those who leave</h2>

<p>I am only aware of one positive or neutral statement about members who leave the Church.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One might ask, “If the gospel is so wonderful, why would anyone leave?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes we assume it is because they have been offended or lazy or sinful. Actually, it is not that simple. In fact, there is not just one reason that applies to the variety of situations.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some of our dear members struggle for years with the question whether they should separate themselves from the Church.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this Church that honors personal agency so strongly, that was restored by a young man who asked questions and sought answers, we respect those who honestly search for truth. It may break our hearts when their journey takes them away from the Church we love and the truth we have found, but we honor their right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience, just as we claim that privilege for ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="become-servants-of-satan">become servants of Satan</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Daniel Tyler recalled: “Soon after the Prophet’s arrival in Commerce (afterwards Nauvoo) from Missouri prison, Brother Isaac Behunin and myself made him a visit at his residence. His persecutions were the topic of conversation. He repeated many false, inconsistent and contradictory statements made by apostates, frightened members of the Church and outsiders. He also told how most of the officials who would fain have taken his life, when he was arrested, turned in his favor on forming his acquaintance. He laid the burden of the blame on false brethren. …</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When the Prophet had ended telling how he had been treated, Brother Behunin remarked: ‘If I should leave this Church I would not do as those men have done: I would go to some remote place where Mormonism had never been heard of, settle down, and no one would ever learn that I knew anything about it.’</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The great Seer immediately replied: ‘Brother Behunin, you don’t know what you would do. No doubt these men once thought as you do. Before you joined this Church you stood on neutral ground. When the gospel was preached, good and evil were set before you. You could choose either or neither. There were two opposite masters inviting you to serve them. When you joined this Church you enlisted to serve God. When you did that you left the neutral ground, and you never can get back on to it. Should you forsake the Master you enlisted to serve, it will be by the instigation of the evil one, and you will follow his dictation and be his servant.’”</p>

<h3 id="become-darkened-and-will-be-burned">become darkened and will be burned</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a superior intelligence bestowed upon such as obey the Gospel with full purpose of heart, which, if sinned against, the apostate is left naked and destitute of the Spirit of God, and he is, in truth, nigh unto cursing, and his end is to be burned. When once that light which was in them is taken from them they become as much darkened as they were previously enlightened, and then, no marvel, if all their power should be enlisted against the truth, and they, Judas-like, seek the destruction of those who were their greatest benefactors.</p>

  <p>Above all, the Church affirms that its members should seek personal revelation to know the truth and live in tune with the spirit of God. Those who have not done this may drop by the wayside when their faith is challenged or when difficulties arise.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apostates sometimes become enemies of the Church. Leaving the Church, which claims to be God’s official church, containing the fulness of the gospel, often results in feelings of guilt. While many return, others develop a need to defend their actions, “disprove” the Church, or become hostile enemies. The fruits of apostasy are generally bitter.</p>

<p>Those who had the Gospel in the former dispensations, and were made partakers of its spirit, its knowledge, and its powers, and then turned away, and became the enemies of God, and of his saints, the malicious and wilful opposers of that which they knew to be true, have no forgiveness in this world, neither in the spirit world, which is the world next to come.</p>

<p>Such apostates seek, in all dispensations, to bring destruction on the innocent and to shed innocent blood, or consent thereto. For such, I again repeat, I know no forgiveness.</p>

  <p>One of the first steps to apostasy is to find fault with your Bishop; and when that is done, unless repented of a second step is soon taken, and by and by the person is cut off from the Church, and that is the end of it. Will you allow yourselves to find fault with your Bishop?</p>

  <p>Being offended Some Church members become offended by the actions of other members and allow an offense to fester until they are led into apostasy. …How do we today allow ourselves to be offended by others? How can being offended lead to apostasy? How can we overcome feelings of being offended?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Soon after the Church was organized, some of the members began to apostatize, or leave the Church. They quit attending Church meetings, opposed the Prophet, and persecuted the Saints. People apostatized for various reasons. For example, one man left the Church because his horse died while he was traveling to join the Saints in Missouri. Another man apostatized after he saw Joseph Smith playing with children. He thought a prophet should be too serious to play with children. One man saw that his name was misspelled on a Church document and thought that meant Joseph Smith was not inspired by God. Other people left the Church because they did not receive the help they expected with their financial problems. Some members left the Church because they could not forgive other members for actions that had offended them. After leaving the Church, these offended people often became the Church’s worst enemies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A few of you may have run into some who have ceased to hold fast to the iron rod, wandered off the straight and narrow path, and have become lost. They started sometimes with online tours of the territory of the faithless. This indiscretion is often accompanied by failing to earnestly study the Book of Mormon every day and by the companion problem of gradually becoming lax in keeping other commandments. This sometimes leads to listening to and then hearkening to those who mock the church, its leaders or its history. The faithless often promote themselves as the wise who can rescue the rest of us from our naiveté. One does not need to listen to assertive apostates for long to see the parallels between them and the ‘Korihors’ ‘Nehors’ and ‘Sherems’ of the book of Mormon. We should disconnect immediately and completely from listening to the proselytizing efforts of those who have lost their faith and instead reconnect promptly with the holy spirit. The adversary sees spiritual apathy and halfhearted obedience as opportunities to encircle us with his chains and bind us—and he hopes to destroy us. We escape his chains as we voluntarily choose to bind ourselves instead to God…</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>ANSWER - ELDER OAKS:…I can imagine that in most circumstances the parents would say, “Please don’t do that. Don’t put us into that position.” Surely if there are children in the home who would be influenced by this example, the answer would likely be that. …”Yes, come, but don’t expect to stay overnight. Don’t expect to be a lengthy house guest. Don’t expect us to take you out and introduce you to our friends, or to deal with you in a public situation that would imply our approval of your “partnership.”</p>

<p>Brigham Young recounted a dream where apostates claimed to be Mormon, and then to have been Mormon.  Young recounted his feelings in his dream, “I felt ashamed of them, for they were in my eyes a disgrace to ‘mormonism.’”  Young then dreams that two ruffians were jumping into bed with one of Young’s wives and children [sexual license may be implied?] and being supported in this by the apostates.  In the dream, Young then recounts cutting the throats of two ruffians (one “ear to ear”) and then threatened others with the same fate.  Finally, Young exclaims to the crowd:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I say, rather than that apostates should flourish here, I will unsheath my bowie knife, and conquer or die. [Great commotion in the congregation, and a simultaneous burst of feeling, assenting to the declaration.] Now, you nasty apostates, clear out, or judgment will be put to the line, and righteousness to the plummet. [Voices, generally, “go it, go it.“] If you say it is right, raise your hands. [All hands up.] Let us call upon the Lord to assist us in this, and every good work.</p>

  <p>To say, as a parent, “I won’t force my kids to go to church. I’ll let them decide on their own.” sounds so enlightened. But its the most dangerous thing a parent could say.

<blockquote>
  <p>My parents had me and my 88 year old grandfather over for dinner. My parents are still TBM’s but don’t force it on me at all. After we ate my grandfather had this really sad look on his face when he was looked at me. I finally asked him what was wrong and he started to cry almost hysterically. He said that he worries about me every day because I won’t be able to join the rest of the family in the celestial kingdom. This went on for almost 10 minutes before he finally calmed down. I wanted to tell him why I don’t believe in the church but that would just upset him even more. For the most part, I’ve just been passive about my beliefs with my family but this really bothered me for some reason. I’m not really sure what to do here because he wasn’t trying to get me to become a believer, nor have my parents over the years. They just have genuine concern about my well-being. I’m not sure how to respond to this really.</p>

  <p>My faith transition has been a very long, slow process (13+months). I’m still closeted to most everyone, but DW knows that I no longer accept the church’s truth claims. Today she asked me why I didn’t say amen after she said a prayer this morning. I tried to very kindly and no[n] confrontationally share, “I’m not sure I believe in Jesus Christ anymore…”. She went away crying. A few minutes later she told me, “being raped by Ted Bundy would be easier than this”. Any suggestions on how to best navigate this?</p>

<p>A video created by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNRlg6O8ekU">LDS Philanthropies</a> suggested that it is appropriate to deny inheritance to children who leave the Church:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For them to inherit my estate they will have to become what I’m trying to become… If they exercise their agency contrary to my beliefs then the option is that entire inheritance can go to the church.</p>

  <p>When i finally told my parents they had never been more dissapointed. my father told me i broke my mothers heart. in the morning before school we would read scriptures and my parents (my own father!!) would just burst out crying and attempt to keep reading. the amount of guilt and shame i had to go through. my parents made me see the bishop and the stake president! when i spoke to the stake president he talked to me about what i hoped to accomplish and basically told me i would never be truly content and would incredibly regret it later if i did not go. I was forced to go to church every sunday and if i didnt my parents would kick me out of the house. and every single sunday at some point in the 3 hours someone will tell me the bishop wanted to see me. then i would be constantly berated by the bishop on what i should do to meet a goal to go on a mission. I was an incredibly quiet and frail person then and would simply say things like “maybe” or “i dont know ill see” this went on for probably 8 months before i got a job that required me to work on sundays so i had an excuse not to go. even after i stopped going the missionaries would make an effort to see me 1-3 times a week! one sister missionary went so far as to point to an old picture of me and say that she saw true happiness in that picture but no longer sees that in my eyes. she said that she knows that i will never achieve true happiness. after this i just about lost it, i didnt really say much, i dont remember the specifics but im sure i was very passive aggressive. after they said the closing prayer i said “thanks” and went straight to my room without dismissing or shaking hands.</p>

A family room full of people and these jerks wouldn’t even turn to say hi. My sweet 17 year old daughter who has this sweet tender heart was SHUNNED. I know I will be angry when I get past being hurt. I hate that my kids are going through this. It just kills me.

  <p>Being never-mo in “Happy” Valley, I try to get along with a live-and-let live policy. It’s just not possible with the level of indoc among TBM’s.  My kid came home from school a little distraught yesterday. I asked “hey kiddo, what’s the problem?” “Oh, the kids at school are teasing me.” “About what? What’d they say?” “This girl in my class said “Everybody who goes to church, raise your hand!” Lots of people did, except me and X and X. They laughed at us and then at recess they were running away from us and said “We’re Mormon and you’re NOT!” and “Don’t play with them, they don’t go to church!” I asked if the teacher was in the room when this happened and was told no, the girl did it after the teacher left for a minute.</p>

  <p>Year 2002, somewhere in Canada.  My LDS high school buddies and I had all received our mission calls around the same time. My friend went to the temple and came back scared. He showed me his temple clothes. I went home and googled info on the church. Down the rabbit hole. Testimony lost in a matter of days.  I told my parents I had to put my mission call on hold because I had lost my faith. I talked to the bishop, the SP, and even the mission president in the mission I was assigned to soon join. None of it helped, obviously. There are no answers for these questions. And back in 2002 everyone thought I had succumbed to anti-mormon lies (there were no LDS essays yet).  I was riding in the car with my dad (former bishop) when he told me he had a revelation that I would be taken from the earth shortly, if I went the route of apostasy.  I didn’t know what to say, so I just said, “Ok…”</p>
