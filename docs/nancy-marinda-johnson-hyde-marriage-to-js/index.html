<h2 id="accounts-of-nancy-johnson-hydes-marriagesealing-to-joseph-smith">Accounts of Nancy Johnson Hyde’s marriage/sealing to Joseph Smith</h2>

<p>Transcription of Compton’s In Sacred Loneliness:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are four antagonistic reports of this marriage. The earliest, from Sidney Rigdon in 1845, has already been partially quoted: “H. [Orson Hyde] by and by finds out the trick which was played off upon him in his absence, by his two faithful friends. His dignity becomes offended, (and well it might) refuses to live with his wife, but to be even with his companions in iniquity, takes to himself three more wives.” By this scenario, Orson did not know of the marriage until 1843. This may well be, and Orson did marry polygamously after he returned to Nauvoo. However, contrary to Rigdon, Orson did not stop living with Marinda at this time and Marinda continued to have children with him until 1858.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Second, according to William Hall, published in 1852, Joseph Smith demanded Orson’s wife and all his money when Orson sued for reinstatement in the church after his Missouri disaffection, and Orson gave her up. This flatly contradicts Rigdon’s account, in which Joseph and Marinda marry without Orson’s knowledge. It could be noted that Hall’s discussion of Zina Huntington’s marriage to Smith was extremely unreliable, which lessens his authority here.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The next account is much later, but still from an early Nauvoo insider, John D. Lee. After describing Hyde’s repentance and mission to Palestine, Lee wrote, “Report said that Hyde’s wife, with his consent, was sealed to Joseph for an eternal state, but I do not assert the fact.” Lee agrees with Hall that Hyde knew of the marriage, but honestly reports that the story was hearsay.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A further antagonistic report by an early Mormon—Ann Eliza Webb Young-sides with Rigdon in suggesting that Orson did not know of the marriage in 1842 and that he was extremely upset when he returned home from his mission and found out that Marinda had married Smith in his absence.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thus the four writers offer no consensus on the issue of Orson’s knowledge. Smith’s other polyandrous marriages and the statements of Lee and Hall suggest that Orson may have known of the marriage beforehand.  However, if Marinda and Joseph had wanted to marry with Orson’s knowledge and consent, they probably would have waited until he returned from his mission before performing the ceremony. Orson’s not knowing is probably the preferable interpretation, but neither view is certain.</p>

<p>Mormon Polygamy Documents <a href="https://mormonpolygamydocuments.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/JS0498.docx">JS0498</a> Johnson Hyde, Marinda Nancy, letter, undated (after Dec. 1, 1841). Transcript.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The peculiarity of my condition in
life seems to call for an explanation
at my hand</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Lord gave me to Joseph Smith
\before I married Orson Hyde. This I did not know until/
ten years after, when Joseph taught me the
doctrine of celestial marriage.  This was in
the fall of 1841 and the following Dec, the
following revelation was brought to me
by Apostle Wilford Woodruff, -</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nauvoo Dec 1, 1841</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Verily thus saith the Lord unto you
my servant Joseph, that inasmuch as you have
called upon me to know my will concerning
my handmaid Nancy Marinda Hyde; behold
it is my will that she should have a better
place prepared for her, than that in which 
she now lives, in order that her life may
be spared unto her; therefore go and say 
unto my servant Ebenezer Robinson and
 to my handmaid his wife, - Let them open
their doors and take her and her children
into their house, and take care of them
faithfully and kindly until my servant
Orson Hyde returns from his mission,
or until some other provision can be
made for their welfare and safety.  Let
them do these things and spare not 
and I the Lord will bless them and 
heal them, if they do it not grudgingly
saith the Lord God; and she shall be a
blessing unto them; and let my handmaid
Nancy Marinda Hyde hearken to the council [sic]
of my servant Joseph in all things whatsoever
he shall teach unto her, and it shall 
be a blessing upon [overwrites ‘unto’] her and upon her 
children after her, unto her justification
saith the Lord.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ebenezer Robinson and wife received
me and mine and gave us shelter until
another place was provided. –  I followed
the council [sic] of the prophet Joseph as
above instructed and cherish in my 
\heart/ the hope of realizing [sic] the fulfillment of 
\the promises and blessings/
here in contained. –</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A few years before Mr. Hyde
departed this life he told me that
Joseph Smith before our marriage, requested
him not to marry me, but gave no 
reason for the request</p>
