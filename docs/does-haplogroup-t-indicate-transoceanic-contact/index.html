    <p>Donald Yates claims in <a href="https://www.academia.edu/9494507/Anomalous_Mitochondrial_DNA_Lineages_in_the_Cherokee">Anomalous Mitochondrial DNA Lineages in the Cherokee</a> (self published in Cherokee DNA Studies: Real People Who Provied the Geneticists wrong) that a significant portion of Cherokee contain haplogroup T and because of the step-wise nature of the group, that this is evidence of a transoceanic dispersal.</p>

<p>There are a few problems with this claim:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The scientific study upon which the claim was made has never been peer reviewed or published in a scientific journal.  Peer review and publication in a scientific journal is viewed by most scholars as a minimum bar for making credible scientific claims.  To date, the claim that haplogroup T supports a transoceanic migration event has not even reached the level of attention that geneticists have felt the need to address it (like they have done <a href="https://anthropology.ku.edu/cherry-picked-genetic-data-does-not-support-ancient-trans-atlantic-migration-professor-says">with X2a</a>).</li>
  <li>Yates appears to have zero years of formal academic training in DNA genetic analysis, although he is the owner of a DNA testing company.  His batchelor and masters degress are in English, his PhD in Classical Studies.  He was a part time communications professor and then an assistant professor for four years “teaching public relations, speech, and other communication arts courses” (from his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/donaldnyates/">LinkedIn profile</a>).  Science is often performed by those with little initial academic training, but these individuals tend to eventually distinguish themselves through publication in peer reviewed journals (e.g., Zack Simpson was a high school drop out <a href="http://www.mine-control.com/zack/">who has co-authored a number of scholarly scientific studies</a>).  As far as I can tell, Yates has authored or co-authored zero peer reviewed publications to date.</li>
  <li>
    <p>At least some individuals used in the study are from Cherokee groups which had such poor ancestral claims that <a href="https://www.bia.gov/as-ia/ofa/227-ctbdch-tn">their petition for federal acknowledgement</a> has <a href="https://www.bia.gov/sites/bia.gov/files/assets/as-ia/ofa/petition/227_ctbdch_TN/227_fd.pdf">been rejected</a> (incidentally, rejected by Larry Echo Hawk, an LDS General Authority at the time).</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The petitioner’s own statements confirm the PF’s analysis of the evidence that Petitioner #227 is
a recently formed group of individuals from diverse origins who claim to have Indian ancestry,
but who have not documented those claims.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>If we are dealing with a genuine genetic signature, an unbiased analysis of <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010070">993</a> and 650,000 SNPs demonstrates that <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/319/5866/1100.full">it is being absolutely dwarfed by many other genetic signatures</a> which all seem consistent with a land-bridge migration.  This doesn’t nullify his research <em>per se</em> (Yates was specifically seeking odd-ball signatures), but these other unbiased studies do undermine the standard narrative typically advanced in both official and unofficial LDS channels for nearly two centuries.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: The second of these points was compiled from a point <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2dltni/important_to_know_that_this_article_is_floating/cjqwnok/">made here</a> (I believe it was made by /u/barefootcherokee, a Native American and former Mormon).</p>
