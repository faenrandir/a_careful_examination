<ul>
  <li>Joseph presented at least one papyrus fragment as literally the writings of Abraham.</li>
  <li>“By his own hand” was meant to be taken as a literal statement.</li>
  <li>Joseph presented the Book of Abraham work as literally a translation of the hieroglyphics. “Translated” means what one would expect in this context.</li>
  <li>Joseph created a grammar and an alphabet where he grossly mistranslated the hieroglyphics.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Public mind has been excited of late by reports which have been circulated of late concerning certain Egyptian Mummies, and Ancient Records which were purchased by certain Gentlemen of Kirtland last July. It has been said that the purchasers of these antiquities pretend they have the body of Abraham, Abimelech, The king of the Philistines. Joseph who was sold into Egypt, &amp;c, &amp;c, for the purpose of attracting the attention of the multitude, and gulling the unwarry; which is utterly false. Who these ancient inhabitants of Egypts were I do not, at present, say. Abraham was buried on his own possession “in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the Son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre,” which he purchased of the sons of Heth; Abimelech lived in the same country and for ought we know died there; and the children of Israel carried Joseph’s bones from Egypt, when they went out under Moses. Consequently could not have been found in Egypt in the nineteenth century. <strong>The record of Abraham and Joseph, found with the Mummies, is beautifully written on papyrus with black, and a small part, red ink or paint, in perfect preservation.</strong> The characters are such as you find upon the coffins of Mummies; hieroglyphics, &amp;c. with <strong>many characters or letters like the present (though probably not quite so square,) form of the Hebrew without points.</strong> “These records were obtained from one of the Catacombs, or in Egypt, near the place where once stood the renowned city of Thebes, by the celebrated French traveller Antonio Lebolo. in the year 1831. He procured license from Mehemet Ali, then Viceroy of Egypt, under the protection of Chevalier Drovetti, the French consul, in the 1828; employed 433 men, four months and two days, (if I understood correctly,) Egyptian or Turkish soldiers, at from four to 6 cents per Diem, each man: entered the catacomb June 7th 1831. and obtained eleven mummies. There were several hundred mummies in the same catacomb; about one hundred embalmed after the first order, and deposited and placed in niches; and two or three hundred after the second and third order; and laid upon the floor or bottom of the grand cavity; The two last orders of Embalmed were so decayed that they could not be removed, and only eleven of the first found in the niches. On his way from Alexandria to Paris he put in at Trieste, and after ten days illness expired. This was in the year 1832. Previous to his decease, he made a will of the whole to Mr Michael H. Chandler, (then in Philadelphia. Pa,) his nephew, whom he supposed to have been in Ireland. Accordingly the whole were sent to Dublin, and Mr Chandler’s friends ordered them to New York, where they were received at the Custom house in the winter or Spring of 1833. In April of the same year, Mr Chandler paid the duties, and took possession of his mummies. Up to this time, they had not been taken out of the coffins nor the coffins opened. On opening the coffins he discovered that in connection with two of the bodies, were something rolled up with the same kind of linen, saturated with the same bitumen, which when examined, proved to be two rolls of papyrus previously mentioned. <strong>Two or three other small pieces of papyrus with astronomical calculations, epitaphs, &amp;c. were found with others of the mummies.</strong> When Mr Chandler discovered that ther[e] was something with the Mummies, he supposed, or hoped it might be some diamonds or valueable Metal, and was no little chagrined, when he saw his disappointment. <strong>He was immediately told, while yet in the Custom house, that there was no man in that city, who could translate his roll; but was referred by the same gentleman, (a stranger) to Mr Joseph Smith Junr— who, continued he, possesses some kind of power or gifts, by which he had previously translated similar characters.”</strong> I was then unknown to Mr Chandler, neither did he know that such a book or work as the record of Nephites had been brought before the public. From New York he took his collection on to Philadelphia, where he obtained the certificate of the learned, (see Mess. &amp; Advocate p. 235,)— and from thence come on to Kirtland as before related in July. <strong>Thus I have given a brief history of the manner in which the writings of the Fathers Abraham, and Joseph have been preserved, and how I came in possession of the same, a correct translation of which I shall give in its proper place.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Undated</strong>, in the history of the church, Vol 2.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The account here given of how the Prophet came into possession of the
writings of Abraham, and of Joseph, the son of Jacob, was adapted from an
article in the Messenger and Advocate, (Volume II, Number 3, pages 233,
236, bearing date of December, 1835) signed by Oliver Cowdery. The article
is addressed to William Frye, Esq.. of Gilead, Calhoun County, Ill. The
certificate of the “learned” referred to, is in the body of the article.
it seems that Michael H. Chandler, the owner of the Egyptian mummies and
the papyrus, exhibited his treasures in Philadelphia, and, while there,
obtained the following opinion of several prominent doctors’</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Having examined with considerable attention and deep interest, a number
of mummies from the catacombs, near Thebes, in Egypt, and now exhibiting
in the Arcade, we beg leave to recommend them to the observation of the
curious inquirer on subjects of a period so long elapsed; probably not
less than three thousand years ago. The features of some of these mummies
are in perfect expression. <strong>The papyrus covered with black or red ink, or
paint, in excellent preservation, are very interesting.</strong> The undersigned,
unsolicited by any person connected by interest with this exhibition, have
voluntarily set their names hereunto, for the simple purpose of calling
the attention of the public to an interesting collection, not sufficiently
know in this city.” JOHN REDMAN COXE M.D., RICHARD HARLAN, M.D., J.
PANCOAST, M. D., WILLIAM P. C. BARTON, M. D., E. F. RIVINUS, M.D., SAMUEL
G. MORGAN, M.D.,</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I concur in the above sentiments, concerning the collection of mummies in
the Philadelphia Arcade, and consider them highly deserving the attention
of the curious. W. E. HORNER, M. D.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another paragraph in the article explains how it came about that Mr.
Chandler gave the Prophet a certificate, concerning his belief in the
Prophet’s ability to decipher the Egyptian hieroglyphics of the
papyrus–which certificate will be found at page 235, of this volume,
under the date of the purchase of the mummies and papyrus by certain
persons in Kirtland. From the paragraph referred to, it appears that on
the morning that <strong>Mr. Chandler first presented his papyrus to the Prophet
Joseph Smith, he was shown by the latter, a number of characters which had
been copied from the Nephite plates, and found that there were some points
of resemblance between some of the Nephite characters and some of the
characters on the Egyptian papyrus</strong>. Mr. Chandler then asked the Prophet’s
opinion concerning the antiquity of the Egyptian papyrus, and also
requested him to give a translation of the characters. <strong>The Prophet gave
Mr. Chandler a translation of some few of the Egyptian characters, which
agreed with the interpretation given by learned men in other cities, where
the mummies and papyrus had been exhibited, whereupon Mr. Chandler gave
the Prophet a certificate. stating that fact.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Bonus: Usage of “his own hand” for comparable context:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First–That all licenses hereafter granted by these authorities
assembled as a quorum, or by general conference held for the purpose of
transacting the business of the Church, be recorded at full length by the
clerk appointed for that purpose, in a book to be kept in this branch of
the Church, until it shall be thought advisable by the heads of the Church
to order other books and appoint other clerks, to record licenses as
above; <strong>and that said recording clerk be required to indorse a certificate
under his own hand and signature</strong>, on the back of said licenses, specifying
the time when, and place where, such license was recorded, and also a
reference to the letter and page of the book containing the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note how the usage does not allow someone to delegate another to act as “his own hand”.  This cuts off the apologetic claim that a copy of a writing is still written by Abraham, “in his own hand”</p>
