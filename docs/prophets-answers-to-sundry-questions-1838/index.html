<p>May 5, 1838</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Tuesday, 8.–I spent the day with Elder Rigdon in visiting Elder Cahoon at the place he had selected for his residence, and in attending to some of our private, personal affairs; also in the afternoon I answered the questions which were frequently asked me, while on my last journey but one from Kirtland to Missouri, as printed in the Elders’ Journal, vol. I, Number 2, pages 28 and 29, as follows:</em></p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Seventh–“Do the Mormons believe in having more wives than one?”</p>

<p>“No, not at the same time. But they believe that if their companion dies, they have a right to marry again. But we do disapprove of the custom, which has gained in the world, and has been practiced among us, to our great mortification, in marrying in five or six weeks, or even in two or three months, after the death of their companion. We believe that due respect ought to be had to the memory of the dead, and the feelings of both friends and children.</p>
