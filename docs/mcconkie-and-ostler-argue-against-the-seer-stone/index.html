<blockquote>
  <p>Finally, the testimony of David Whitmer simply does not accord with the divine pattern. If Joseph Smith translated everything that is now in the Book of Mormon without using the gold plates, <strong>we are left to wonder why the plates were necessary in the first place</strong>. It will be remembered that possession of the plates placed the Smith family in considerable danger, causing them a host of difficulties. If the plates were not part of the translation process, this would not have been the case. <strong>It also leaves us wondering why the Lord directed the writers of the Book of Mormon to make a duplicate record of the plates of Lehi.</strong> This provision which compensated for the loss of the 116 pages would have served no purpose either. Further, <strong>we would be left to wonder why it was necessary for Moroni to instruct Joseph each year for four years before he was entrusted with the plates</strong>. We would also wonder <strong>why it was so important for Moroni to show the plates to the three witnesses, including David Whitmer</strong>. And <strong>why did the Lord have the Prophet show the plates to the eight witnesses</strong>? Why all this flap and fuss if the Prophet didn’t really have the plates and if they were not used in the process of translation?  <strong>What David Whitmer is asking us to believe is that the Lord had Moroni seal up the plates and the means by which they were to be translated hundreds of years before they would come into Joseph Smith’s possession and then decided to have the Prophet use a seer stone found while digging a well so that none of these things would be necessary after all. Is this, we would ask, really a credible explanation of the way the heavens operate?</strong></p>
