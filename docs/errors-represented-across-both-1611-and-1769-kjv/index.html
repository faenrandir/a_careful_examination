  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Of the 8 verses from the Book of Mormon that contain possible or likely <a href="/a_careful_examination/scholar-survey-kjv-translation-errors-in-bom-isaiah/">KJV translation errors</a> all of these “errors” seem to be preserved in the 1611 King James Version.</p>

<p>In general, the Book of Mormon appears to rely exclusively on the 1769 King James translation (compared with the 1611 King James Version or other derivatives) in <em>other</em> instances where the two texts diverge.</p>

<p>For instance, compare Isaiah 49:13 (and 1 Nephi 21:13):</p>

<ul>
  <li>1611 - Sing, O heauen, and be ioyfull, O earth, and breake forth into singing, O mountaines: for <strong>God</strong> hath comforted his people, and will haue mercy vpon his afflicted.</li>
  <li>1769 - Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for <strong>the LORD</strong> hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.</li>
  <li>BofM - Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; for the feet of those who are in the east shall be established; and break forth into singing, O mountains; for they shall be smitten no more; for <strong>the Lord</strong> hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, the Book of Mormon appears <strong>not</strong> to have been directly influenced by the 1611 KJV syntax, as reported in Royal Skousen and Stanford Carmack’s latest BYU Studies article (2018, from a pre-print copy):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… Stanford Carmack has found that the Book of Mormon syntax matches best what we find in English from the second half of the 1500s, but <strong>it does not match the syntax of the 1611 King James Bible</strong> … (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, in matters of style and spelling, it seems clear that the Book of Mormon generally followed after the 1769 KJV but not the 1611 version.</p>

<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/wordtreefoundation/bomdb">bomdb</a> to pull from the Book of Mormon, which defaults to the 1829 edition.  I used <a href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/1611-Bible/">this 1611 KJV</a> and <a href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/">this 1769 KJV</a>.</p>
