    <p>The modern Church adopted a prohibitionist perspective on alcohol (i.e., there is never a good reason to consume a single drop recreationally or even for special occasions/sacraments).  The reasoning seems best expressed by Joseph F. Smith:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We do not want to bring Babylon here—the gathering place appointed by the Lord for his people; but we want to take every precaution and to adopt every preventive measure in our power to stay the inroads of the evils which characterize Babylon, which are so condemned in the laws of God, and which are so repugnant to the spirit of the gospel. We do not want these things here; but we are not supreme; we cannot govern as we would wish. Not that we desire to rule with an iron hand, oppressively. It would not be oppression to me, for the proper authorities to say,—”You shall not take intoxicating liquors; you shall neither manufacture nor drink them, for they are injurious to your body and mind,” nor would it be to any Saint,—but what oppression it would be to a certain class! <strong>Yet I hope to see the day when, within the pale of the kingdom of God, no man will be allowed to take intoxicating liquor;</strong> and make—I was going to say, a beast of himself. But I do not name it, rather to make a degraded man of himself. Beasts would not degrade themselves as men do. The habits of the brutes are decent in the eyes of God and angels when compared with the conduct of drunken, debauched men, who pollute mind and body by the commission of every species of vice and crime. <strong>I want to see the day when no man in the midst of this people will be allowed to touch intoxicating drink to become drunken.</strong> But if we we were to attempt to enforce this rule, what would be the hue and cry? “Tyranny, and oppression;” and armies would be sent here to use up the “Mormons;” and yet if such a rule could be enforced it would be a blessing, and no man can deny it; and if it were enforced it would only be carrying out the principles of “Mormonism.” (emphasis added; <a href="http://en.fairmormon.org/Journal_of_Discourses/14/40#284">source</a>)</p>
