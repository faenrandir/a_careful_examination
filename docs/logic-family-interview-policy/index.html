    <p><em>Background: I originally posted a comment on /r/latterdaysaints about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/latterdaysaints/comments/3h7nb1/our_family_ecclesiastical_interview_policy_a/">our family ecclesiastical interview policy</a>.  It was met with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/latterdaysaints/comments/3h7nb1/our_family_ecclesiastical_interview_policy_a/cu4zrke/">some resistance</a>, so I wrote out my logic <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/latterdaysaints/comments/3hehbx/formalization_of_the_logic_behind_our_family/">here</a>.  The post was shadowbanned by latterdaysaint mods (which means they deleted it without informing me it was deleted).  Then, I submitted the post to r/exmormon  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/43xbfh/formalization_of_the_logic_behind_family/">here</a>.  I formulated this logic, which was influenced by lots of stories and stances shared on /r/exmormon, a couple of years before the <a href="https://protectldschildren.org/">protectldschildren</a> campaign began.</em></p>

<p>Our family policy, which I think should be adopted at a church-wide level is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unless our children ask to speak with a leader in private (which they know they can do and which we’d fully support), one of us should always be present at their worthiness interviews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s my rationale:</p>

<h2 id="a-abuse">A. Abuse</h2>

<h3 id="a1-discussion-of-a-childs-sexual-practices-is-more-sensitive-than-other-kinds-of-discussions-that-might-occur-between-a-child-and-an-adult">A1. Discussion of a child’s sexual practices is more sensitive than other kinds of discussions that might occur between a child and an adult.</h3>

<p>A1a.  Discussion of a child’s sexual practices is at least somewhat intrinsic to questions about the law of chastity.</p>

<p>A1b. Because of the topic, discussion along these lines has a higher potential to cause significant developmental damage to occur in the event of intended or accidental abuse (e.g. improper questioning).</p>

<h3 id="a2-in-worthiness-interviews-leaders-may-inadvertently-say-or-imply-harmful-things-given-that-they">A2. In worthiness interviews, leaders may inadvertently say or imply harmful things given that they:</h3>

<p>A2a. typically lack professional training in counseling</p>

<p>A2b. typically lack education or significant training in childhood and teenage sexual development</p>

<p>A2c. may feel that their role requires them to probe the child’s sexual practices.</p>

<h3 id="a3-both-major-molestation-and-minor-inappropriate-questioning-abuse-of-children-by-ecclesiastical-leaders-is-documented-in-many-instances--with-no-change-in-current-practices-it-is-not-a-matter-of-if-it-is-only-a-matter-of-when">A3. Both major (molestation) and minor (inappropriate questioning) abuse of children by ecclesiastical leaders is documented in many instances.  With no change in current practices, it is not a matter of <em>if</em>, it is only a matter of <em>when</em>.</h3>

<h3 id="a4-a-child-is-in-an-inherently-vulnerable-position-in-a-one-on-one-bishop-interview">A4. A child is in an inherently vulnerable position in a one-on-one Bishop interview:</h3>

<p>A4a. The Bishop is likely a highly respected figure in the church and community generally, and is the highest local authority by the members of the ward family.</p>

<p>A4b. A child is likely to be unaware of whether a question or topic is inappropriate.</p>

<p>A4c. A child may not feel they can refuse to answer a question, even if they feel it is inappropriate.</p>

<p>A4d. A child may not know where the appropriate line is in confessing any sins.</p>

<h3 id="a5-having-another-adult-present-virtually-eliminates-the-risk-for-major-abuse-to-occur-and-significantly-mitigates-the-potential-for-minor-and-inadvertant-abuse-to-occur-since-a-bishop-and-the-child-is-far-more-likely-to-keep-the-discussion-at-an-appropriate-level-when-another-adult-is-present">A5. Having another adult present virtually eliminates the risk for major abuse to occur and significantly mitigates the potential for minor and inadvertant abuse to occur since a Bishop (and the child) is far more likely to keep the discussion at an appropriate level when another adult is present.</h3>

<h2 id="b-comfort-and-anxiety">B. Comfort and Anxiety</h2>

<h3 id="b1-discussion-of-a-childs-sexuality-is-likely-to-be-unsettling-to-a-child">B1. Discussion of a child’s sexuality is likely to be unsettling to a child.</h3>

<h3 id="b2-a-child-may-feel-more-comfortable-in-such-a-situation-with-a-parent-present">B2. A child may feel more comfortable in such a situation with a parent present.</h3>

<h3 id="b3-causing-significant-anxietydiscomfort-in-another-individual-needlessly-is-unethical-ie-would-be-grounds-for-dismissing-or-modifying-a-psychology-study-for-instance">B3. Causing significant anxiety/discomfort in another individual <em>needlessly</em> is unethical (i.e., would be grounds for dismissing or modifying a psychology study, for instance).</h3>

<h2 id="c-minimal-impact-on-a-bishops-effectiveness">C. Minimal impact on a Bishop’s effectiveness</h2>

<h3 id="c1-having-a-parent-or-advocate-present-as-a-matter-of-default-ie-unless-a-child-declines-would-not-be-expected-to-significantly-interfere-with-and-may-even-augment-the-ability-of-a-bishop-to-ascertain-worthiness-shepherd-a-teen-through-the-repentance-process-andor-act-as-a-judge-in-israel">C1. Having a parent or advocate present as a matter of default (i.e., unless a child declines) would not be expected to significantly interfere with, and may even augment, the ability of a Bishop to ascertain worthiness, shepherd a teen through the repentance process, and/or act as a judge in Israel.</h3>

<p>C1a. What, precisely, can a Bishop not ask or say if a parent is present that would be appropriate to ask or say if a parent were not present (related to a worthiness interview)? **</p>

<p>C1b. A parent knows their child the best and may be able to provide needed context for the Bishop.  A parent may also be able to properly interpret the words of the Bishop for their child and to provide follow up as needed.</p>

<h2 id="therefore">Therefore:</h2>

<h3 id="d-encouraging-or-allowing-parents-to-be-present-unless-their-presence-is-declined-by-the-child-seems-like-a-reasonable-way-to-virtually-eliminate-both-major-and-minor-cases-of-abuse-and-to-decrease-unecessary-anxietydiscomfort-for-childrenteens">D. Encouraging or allowing parents to be present (unless their presence is declined by the child) seems like a reasonable way to virtually eliminate both major and minor cases of abuse and to decrease unecessary anxiety/discomfort for children/teens.</h3>

<hr />

<p>**  Of course, a Bishop is not likely to ask a child about whether their parent is abusing them if a parent is present.  However, this line of questioning is not intrinsically related to a worthiness interview.  And, a question like that may be asked at <em>any time</em> by <em>any leader</em> and does not require a closed door.  In fact, BSA protocol already addresses this by recommending that a discussion like this happen just out of earshot but in plain sight of the group.  A closed door, one-on-one interview is not necessary to ascertain this information.</p>
