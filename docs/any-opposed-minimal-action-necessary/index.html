    <p>Several have suggested that the vocal “opposed” of these individuals was inappropriate.  After reviewing the history of opposed votes, as well as a statement regarding these individuals’ intent, it seems that the manner in which they expressed their opposing vote was the minimal action necessary in order to ensure that the vote would be noted (and hence, I would argue, was not inappropriate).</p>

<p>1977: As described in <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/general-conference/1977/10/the-sustaining-of-church-officers?lang=eng">The Sustaining of Church Officers</a>, Byron Marchant voted in opposition by the same sign, but President Tanner said it seemed that the voting had been unanimous.  In order to register his vote of opposition, Byron then had to engage President Tanner in almost a full conversation from the balcony.</p>

<p>2011: James Shaffer silently raised his hand in two different General Conferences (see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/31j32b/i_am_don_braegger_i_also_voted_opposed_ama/cq2dopi/">comment on reddit.com</a>).  Both the April and October General Conference sustaining votes are recorded “unanimous” (“insofar as I have been able to observe”).</p>

<p>2012: Reddit user JohnBrownsBody claims to have voted in opposition by the same sign but his vote was not recognized (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/rotuc/the_voting_so_far_as_i_have_been_able_to_observe/">source</a>).  Vote “unanimous”.</p>

<p>The AnyOpossed individuals were aware of these preceding events (based on the dialog found in the source below).  And in their own words:</p>

<p>We all talked much about what was the minimal amount of action needed to show opposition and have it recognized, yet not be viewed as disruptive and be taken out by security. I think we acted as appropriately and respectfully as we could have. (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/31j32b/i_am_don_braegger_i_also_voted_opposed_ama/cq251n3/">source</a>)</p>
