    <p><em>Modified from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/7xfo3i/although_the_lord_commanded_the_adoption_of/">here</a></em></p>

<p>The lds.org essay on <a href="https://www.lds.org/topics/plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo?lang=eng">polygamy in Kirtland and Nauvoo</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although the Lord commanded the adoption—and later the cessation—of plural marriage in the latter days, He did not give exact instructions on how to obey the commandment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instructions given in scripture appear not to have been followed (Note: the
latter portion of D&amp;C 132 <em>may</em> have been given after Joseph had taken most of
his polygamous wives).</p>

  <p><strong>“If a man marries both a woman and her mother, it is wicked.</strong> Both he and they must be burned in the fire, so that no wickedness will be among you.”</p>

<p>Leviticus 20:14</p>

<p><em>Marries Patty Bartlett Sessions and Silvia Sessions Lyon, mother and daughter.</em></p>

  <p><strong>“Do not take your wife’s sister as a rival wife</strong> and have sexual relations with her while your wife is living.”</p>

<p>Leviticus 18:18</p>

<p><em>Marries Sarah and Mariah Lawrence, Mary Ann and Olive Frost, Zina and Presendia Huntington, and Emily and Eliza Partridge.</em></p>

<p>Romans 7:3</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…if a man receiveth a wife in the new and everlasting covenant, and <strong>if she be with another man… she hath committed adultery and shall be destroyed.”</strong></p>

<p>Doctrine and Covenants 132:41</p>

<p>Doctrine and Covenants 132:61</p>

<p><em>Marries 16 women who are definitely not virgins, and 11 of whom are vowed to other men.</em></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Doctrine and Covenants 132:63</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord… Wherefore, my brethren… there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none… <strong>if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jacob 2:24-30</p>

<p><em>Doesn’t have a single child with anyone but Emma, making the whole point of polygamy moot.</em></p>
