  <div class="post-content">
    <p>On May 7, 2017, in a ward somewhere in Eagle Mountain, Utah, a girl named Savannah got up and bore her testimony.  Before she could finish <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_0nhyP6dU4">she was asked/told to sit down</a>.  She explains her motivation <a href="http://iliketolookforrainbows.com/2017/05/30/episode-2-savannahs-story-the-transcript/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here was what she said (statements are numbered for reference):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Hi my name is Savannah, and I want to share my testimony with you.</li>
  <li>I believe I am a child of heavenly parents.</li>
  <li>I don’t know if they talk to us</li>
  <li>but I feel in my heart that they made me and that they love me.</li>
  <li>I believe I was made the way I am, all parts of me, by my heavenly parents.</li>
  <li>They did not mess up when they gave me brown eyes or when I was born bald.</li>
  <li>They did not mess up when they gave me freckles or when they made me to be gay.</li>
  <li>God loves me just this way, because I believe that he loves all his creations.</li>
  <li>I do believe he made me this way on purpose.</li>
  <li>No part of me is a mistake.</li>
  <li>I do not choose to be this way, and it is not a fad.</li>
  <li>I cannot make someone else gay and being around me won’t make anyone else this way.</li>
  <li>I believe that God wants us to treat each other with kindness, even if people are different.</li>
  <li>Especially if they are different.</li>
  <li>Christ showed us this.</li>
  <li>I believe that we should just love.</li>
  <li>I believe I am good.</li>
  <li>I try my best to be nice to each other adn stick up for those that are hurting.</li>
  <li>I know I’m not a horrible sinner for being who I am.</li>
  <li>I believe God would tell me if I was wrong.</li>
  <li>I hope someday to go on dates, go to school dances, to hold hands, to go off to college.</li>
  <li>I hope to find a partner and have a great job.</li>
  <li>I hope to get married and have a family.</li>
  <li>I know these dreams and wishes are good and right.</li>
  <li>I know I can have all of these things as a lesbian and be happy.</li>
  <li>I believe that if God is there, he knows I am perfect, just the way I am.</li>
  <li>and would never ask me to live my life alone or with someone I am not attracted to.</li>
  <li>He would want me to be happy.</li>
  <li>I want to be happy.</li>
  <li>I want to love myself and not to feel shame for being me.</li>
</ol>

<p>I ask you…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can you sit down?</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>[Bishopric member]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Brothers and sisters, I ask you to recognize that we are all children of God, we are loved by our Heavenly Father.  And, I have no doubt that Heavenly Father has made us all unique in different ways and for that I am grateful.  And, I am grateful for all of you that are here today as sons and daughters of God.  And I know very much and I’m grateful for Heavenly Father’s plan for us.  And I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>[Conclusion - the rest of what Savannah had prepared but was unable to deliver]</p>

<ol>
  <li>I ask that you all pay close attention to what you say, you never know who is listening.</li>
  <li>I had dreams of going to the temple and getting married, and was very sad when I found out that would never happen for me.</li>
  <li>Today I choose to find my joy outside of my old dreams from when I was little.  I have new dreams and I know my earthly parents and my Heavenly parents love and accept me just the way I am.  Amen.</li>
</ol>
