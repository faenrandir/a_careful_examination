<hr />

<p>Nauvoo March 15, 1844. To the brethren of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints living on China Creek, in Hancock County, Greeting:—Whereas Brother Richard Hewitt has called on me to-day, to know my views concerning some doctrines that are preached in your place, and states to me that some of your elders say, that a man <em>having a certain priesthood</em>, may have as many wives as he pleases, and that doctrine is taught here: I say unto you that that man teaches <em>false doctrine</em>, for there is no such doctrine taught here; neither is there any such thing practised here.  And any man that is found teaching privately or publicly any such doctrine, is culpable, and will stand a chance to be brought before the High Council, and lose his license and membership also: therefore he had better beware what he is about.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>In the bonds of the everlasting covenant,</p>

<p>I am</p>

<p>Your obedient servant,</p>

<p>HYRUM SMITH</p>
