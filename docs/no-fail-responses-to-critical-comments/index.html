    <p><em>From a post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/9wl0vb/feeling_judged_heres_10_nofail_responses_to/">here</a></em></p>

<p>When you leave the church, it’s possible to hear comments like this directed at you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You’ve ruined our eternal family.</li>
  <li>It would be better if you died than left the church.</li>
  <li>Your children need the church in order to make good choices.</li>
  <li>That [bad thing] happened to you because you left the church</li>
  <li>You’ve been deceived by Satan.</li>
  <li>You no longer have the light of Christ.</li>
  <li>I pray something will happen to humble you so you’ll come back to the church.</li>
  <li>You must have done something wrong. Did you cheat on your spouse?</li>
</ul>

<p>In case you experience this, here’s some responses you can keep in your back pocket:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are welcome to think that about me. I’m comfortable in my decisions.</li>
  <li>I understand why you might see things that way.</li>
  <li>Thank you. I’m sure you meant that in the kindest way possible.</li>
  <li>I’m sorry to hear that’s what’s going through your head.</li>
  <li>I can only imagine that it’s hard for you to understand where I’m coming from.</li>
  <li>If you’re hurting for me, I want you to know I’m at peace. If you’re hurting for you, I hope you can find comfort in whatever way works best for you.</li>
  <li>It must be scary for you to see me leave the church. I’m sorry you’re having such a hard time making sense of all this.</li>
  <li>You sound worried. I know you wouldn’t worry if you didn’t care.</li>
  <li>There may not be anything I can do to that would lead you to see me differently, but if you ever want to listen with an open mind, I’d be willing to share my journey.</li>
  <li>You might be right. If you are – that’s fine. I don’t need to be right.</li>
</ul>
