<ul>
  <li><strong>October 1841</strong> - Smith wrote to Zina: “put it off till an angel with a drawn sword stood by me and told me if I did not establish that principle [plurality of wives] upon the earth I would lose my position and my life.” [document this] (<a href="https://imgur.com/a/uprjM">Bradley and Woodward. Plurality, Patriarchy, and the Priestess: Zina D. H. Young’s Nauvoo Marriages. Journal of Mormon History 20:1, 1994, p95</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>October 27, 1841</strong> - Smith married (sealed?) to Zina. (see <a href="https://josephsmithspolygamy.org/plural-wives-overview/zina-diantha-huntington/">Brian Hales’s
polygamy site</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>January 17, 1842</strong> - Henry Jacobs was called on a mission to Chicago with Amos Fuller <a href="https://dcms.lds.org/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?dps_pid=IE285175&amp;page=19">Historical Department journal history of the Church, 17 January 1842</a></li>
