    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>John D. Lee was in a disciplinary (?) council with the Q12.  Towards the end of the council, Brigham Young discussed his personal philosophy on women and honesty (some minor punctuation and spelling errors have been corrected; see appendix for original D. Michael Quinn transcription):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… If you get a woman that is so righteous when punched sore she would not lie, it’s a miracle. … I know of instances in the Church where 90 times or 100 he will tell you the truth; 99 times out of a man where you will get once a woman to answer. Take a sister and she will cry and look and live in the name of the Lord when a man will tell the truth. Men are honest—but women have to be dependent [on] men for their Salvation. <strong>You get a woman that won’t lie when punched hard enough, and if she won’t lie, she is a miracle</strong>. I’ll tell you I never love a woman so well that I cannot say good bye. …</p>
</blockquote>

  <p>[Minutes, Quorum of Twelve] 9 Decem[be]r 1847</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bro John D Lee said to me that Brigham told him if he would give up Emeline to him he would uphold him in time and in eternity &amp; he never should fall, but that he would sit at his right hand in his kingdom-</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bro Lee also said he had frigged Louisa Free 20 times in one night and I told him I did not believe it, [but] he called God and Angels to witness that he told the truth-I then told him he was a bigger fool than I thought he was if he would allow his arse to run away with his head, [and] he said he believed he had the Devil in him for he could not get satisfied, [and] he went home from here after frigging so often and frigged all the women he had in his house. [He] also told him me that Emeline Woolsey was a dirty little strumpet &amp; if she went of[f] to St Louis or St Joseph where her Bro[ther]: was that she would allow everybody to frigg her &amp; he would not take her when she came back.</p>

  <p>Dec[ember]. 9, 1847. 11 A.M. A Special Council At a meeting of the Council of the Twelve &amp; Presidency of Seventies in the Council House.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Present. Pres[iden]ts. [Willard] Richards, [Ezra T.] Benson, [George A.] Smith, [Wilford] Woodruff, [Brigham] Young, [Orson] Pratt, J[oseph]. Young, Z[era]. Pulsipher, A[lbert]. P. Rockwood, G[eorge]. D. Grant, B[enjamin]. L. Clapp, Bishop Knight, A[aron]. Johnson, W[illia]m. I. Appleby.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>J[ohn]. D. Lee appeared to answer to his past misconduct-</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Joseph Young opened by prayer (24 min[utes] to 12) &amp; then stated the cause of being called together. [B]ro. J. D. Lee is one of the 70s. [T]here is not a man in this Camp but what has heard of bro Lee &amp; his family. I have turned a deaf ear on acc[oun]t. of the delicate nature of the case-I could not stop any longer-&amp; the enquiry is what shall we do-I must enquire into bro Lee s circ[umstanc]es if I run ag[ain]st. a Snag. [T]his is a Council of enquiry-Documents have been written to me, from Sis Nancy Bean, Martha Berry &amp; I want to know if these things are so-[T]his is a matter of fellowship with me, not [that] a man shall be exonerated from such things-I want to know if we are big enough to reprove bro Lee &amp; save his Soul-&amp; for the Twelve to say if we are right or wrong-</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rob[er]t. Campbell read a document from Nancy Bean., also another Document by G[eorge].</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>D. Grant-[T]hese things concern a matter of fellowship-&amp; I want bro Lee as know as he is one of the 70s that he is bef[ore]: the proper tribunal-</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>J. D. Lee [said he] has a charge that he never expected to be on his head-[A]s the God that rules in heaven &amp; before God &amp; Angels the greater part of the statements are false-I did not suppose any man had greater veneration for authorities than me-[T]o the best of my knowledge I never made use of such expressions in regard to Joseph-So help me God-[S]everal attempts were made to remove me from Presiding where I was-I wanted to know what crime I had committed-an enquiry was made. I said I was a Hi[gh] Priest, &amp; never said I was not a 70-[T]he difference was settled between me &amp; the parties who were concerned in my household affairs-[T]he police decided they had nothing to do with it-[T]here were more lies told in this Winter Quarters about me last Summer than wo[ul]d. fill this Council House, if each lie was no bigger than a mustard seed-I made arrangements with Sister Beans Father about Nancy going with me next Spring-[S]he treated me most shameful-she is very high Spirited. I never sent Caroline Williams away from me-[though] she had done enough for me to send her off.-I have been imprudent in some things-I am sorry these things are raked up to destroy my influence-[M]y feelings have been this Summer that I wo[ul]d. be glad if the Earth would open &amp; swallow me up, &amp; I would be glad if it were so now-I have always been obedient to the Council &amp; am now-why I sho[ul]d. be accused in this way I know not-&amp; am sorry to see persons who take pleasure in causing me to suffer. (proceding by Jos[ep]h. Young or questioned)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>G[eorge]. D. Grant[:] I had no such idea of persecution altho[ugh] I heard this conversation of shooting one another-I wanted the thing settled-I can find dozens of men in this Court who he has talked to about his frigging his Women-I have heard it from dozens-&amp; things a great deal more ridiculous than that-I like to see things done right. I dont want to see a man walk up bef[ore]. bro. Young full of compassion, &amp; behind his back full of devil-</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jos[ep]h. Young [:] If I understand what decency is-these matters try his salvation. /fellowship./ [F]irst one &amp; then another come down &amp; tell me these things-[B]ro Stewart tells me all manner of stuff about bro Lee. Sister Bean told me these things as being in the presence of God-</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know by the Sp[irit] of the Lord that bro Lee got some of those women by fraud-&amp; I know he ought to be whipt-[M]y Soul is wrung out of me by these things &amp; he ought to feel the smart of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[B]r Lee was disgusted at me in Nauvoo when I proposed to him to pick a Quorum of his own &amp; for him to preside-[B]ut he said he wo[ul]d. not be content unless he was in my Councils-[H]e is tyrannical-&amp; no man got the bighead more than he had-[W]ill every man &amp; woman come from the Farm &amp; make complaints without some foundation[?]-Sis Berry says that the language in your house is [the] same as a Common Strumpet House-I know that bro Lee is worthy of reproof-&amp; unless he alters his course he cannot have the fellowship of the Quo[rum]. of the 70s. I dont want any man to cover up the truth-I know that his course is most dastardly, calling every woman bitches, strumpets, &amp; every thing nasty about the privates-[H]e has got to walk up to virtue &amp; chastity &amp; lead his women by a thread, instead of driving them with a cable-[H]e has been too big for his Cloth. I know it O Lord-[blank] (H. C. Kimball came in) [D]oes God love every man [a]like[?]-</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[H]e is no respecter of persons-[L]et it go on the Dockets &amp; stand against him-if he is unrighteous he is unrighteous &amp; will be dealt with accord[in]g. to his merits-I have heard testimonies enough about it-&amp; all the Sophistry he can make use of until Sundown can make me bel[iev]e otherwise-</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[B]r Lee has not denied those charges, he has threatened to cut one of his women s throats-&amp; drove another out of his house-[W]hat a poor consolation it is to call me daddy, or husband, with hell to look upon in his house-[H]e will have to have his Sp[irit] melted down like Wax-[I]f he throws out braces ag[ain]st. reproof he is bound to be more deserving of reproof than he now is-[Y]our being in bro Brighams family will not save you, unless you do right-[I]t is disgraceful &amp; wicked in the sight of God-Martha Berry told me it was thro[ugh] deception.-I just bel[ieve], if “ of the Stories are true that every one of them are liberated from him &amp; he cannot hold them unless it is their own free will to stay-</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>J. D. Lee[:] I do not put my foot ag[ain]st. reproof. I am not going to say it is not so-it is useless to say any thing in justification-&amp; I will try &amp; be like wax. I want you to hang on to me &amp; not cast me off. I pray God that things will come out as they are-&amp; let every body suffer who deserves it-[E]very thing about Sis Berry is to get her awa[y] from me &amp; to seal her to Amasa Lyman-[P]erhaps I have been too forward-I ask every one pardon. I hope some day all things will be investigated-[A]s to bro Johnson he will run his race short with any one I prophecy that- (B[righam]. Y[oung].[: N]ot while I have any thing to do with him.)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A. P. Rockwood[:] I feel that bro. Joseph has hoed him down pretty severely &amp; not without cause-</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>B. Y.[: W]hat we do here is for anoth each others good-[W]e must not quench the Sp[irit]. of the L[or]d., if it comes like forked lightning let it come-</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>J. D. Lee[:] I saw Martha Berry ab[ou]t. 3 weeks ago &amp; talked with her, [and] she said her mother was expecting I would be cut off from the Church &amp; she was told to hold on-</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>B. L. Clapp[:] Mrs. Berry told me of these same things-[M]y advice to Martha was [to] keep your Covenant with bro Lee-I am sorry of bro Lee s failures &amp; imperfections-he is a passionate man-I would be glad to see him redeem himself-I feel that t</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>he reproof has been from the Lord-</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>B Y.[: I] ask J. D. Lee, did you sa[y] to M. Bean what you had done for her was by bro.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Brigham s council[?]-Ans[we].r.[:] I have had a deal of trouble with that woman-she wo[ul]d. curse &amp; swear like a trooper-I told her to go away if she was dissatisfied-[and] she caused Louisa to be dissatisfied-I struck Louisa with a switch-[S]he humbled herself-I was sorry-[and] she acknowledged it was all for her good-</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jos[ep]h. Young[:] Did you whip your old wife[?]-J D Lee[:] No Sir.-I am satisfied we never sho[ul]d. have any trouble-I never threw the brick at her as God is my judge.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>J. Young-Wherever a man goes beyond, where is placed, that thing begins to react &amp; falls back on him-[W]here God places a man he can manage that thing even to splitting a hair-If bro Lee had weighed himself in the sight of God he wo[ul]d. have saved himself &amp; this thing wo[ul]d. not have happened-[W]ithout there is a reformation in bro Lee he can not have the fellowship of the 70s. [H]is soul must be chastened bef[ore]. the Lord-[H]e must be reproved, that he may be saved-God is no respecter of persons-Go it. Go it. with the smoothing plane until the Sp[irit] of the L[or]d. comes down &amp; when these are righted-uphold him bef[ore]. all things-I pray God that bro Lee may-I wo[ul]d. wash his feet &amp; anoint him over again.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>B. Young. I have heard men talk of these Stories-[S]ome ma[y] have feelings right-others wrong-I have feelings ag[ain]st. conduct-I know bro G[eorge]. D. Grant has no feelings ag[ain]st. bro Lee, for I am a judge of Sp[irit]-I know what bro Joseph has said is spiritually true-I have trembled for bro Lee. I have been afraid of him going so far as to leave the Ch[urch]-[H]e has not got wisdom to manage such big business. I expect he did wrong-I told him how to divide the land-&amp; draw cuts-I understand bro. Lee took 70 acres-&amp; sent Men a great wa[y] to cultivate 2 acres. I know that bro Lee has women who are disgusted with such Language-[M]y Council is not to get so many Women together, it is a ticklish matter-</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>J. Young[: A]s regards [to] the great no. [number] of bre[thre]n with me, you have got to take a strait course with your men &amp; women-[E]ither release the[m], or have them passive-I feel that a man who has power with the Lord, should quell down this Sp[irit]-[I]f it continues you will be lopt off-[I]f you plead you have done right that s no justification-[C]ry out forgive me &amp; I will try to do good-</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>B. Young[:] I wo[ul]d. say to every man &amp; woman [that] I am perfectly willing. I will give you a writing-be free, be happy, I say to you-I know bro Lee s course-I have trembled for him, lest he sho[ul]d. soar where he co[ul]d. not keep his balance &amp; fall. [T]here is no o[the]r. course for bro Lee but to let every man &amp; woman be free-[I]f you take 99 men &amp; women out of 100-he will tell you 99 truths to the woman telling 1 truth-[T]he women will cry to think that I should think so-[T]hey will lie in the name of the Lord-&amp; in their own name-[T]hey are dependent on men to save them-I feel that I co[ul]d. say to every man &amp; woman go in peace &amp; the Lord bless you &amp; I bless you-but yet I would lug the load just as long as the Lord helps me-(5 min[utes] past 2)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>B. Y.[:] I decide that your remarks to bro Lee have been just &amp; right.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>J. Y.[:] I move that bro Lee puts himself in the attitude to his family. that B. Y.[:] /I move that/ The best way is to call a family meeting &amp; talk to them, tell them he is frank &amp; free &amp; wants to do right. &amp; if [there is] any wrong [it] is in them [and] they to bear it-[I]f they want their liberty they are perfectly free-[T]hey have either to turn round &amp; hold their tongues or admit they are in the wrong-</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>J. D. Lee sec[onde]d. [A]ll said I [aye].</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want bro Lee to take a solemn, calm, judicious course &amp; not speak unbecoming of his women folks-</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>J. Y.[:] bro Lees send a letter to Nancy Bean &amp; Martha Berry &amp; all you can get together-I thank God my Heavenly Father, for this doing my duty this day &amp; thank bro Brigham for helping me to do my duty-</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Answer-No-[H]e may have a dancing School, on the understanding that br Gates pays “th of the proceeds to Bishop Knights for the benefit of the poor-and brother Gates proposes to pay another fourth to bro.

I don t like to have anything to do in cases where matters so delicate come before us. [A]s to Bro. Lee s carreer. there is not a man in this Council but knows something of Bro Lee &amp; his family. I have turned a deaf ear to those who have come to me about him. I am Bro Lees friend &amp; he mine. &amp; I have never taken any action.

I just know that the Br love Bro Lee but his course-I have trembled for Bro Lee. [I] knew his disposition &amp; mind., lest he should soar to where he would lose his Balance to rise no more. [There is] no other course for Bro Lee. but to give every liberty to all belonging him then he will feel free-If you get a woman that is so righteous when punched sore she would not lie. It s a miracle. Men &amp; women are n &amp; n. I know of instances in the Ch[urch] [where] 90 tim[es] or 100. he will tell you the truth, 99 times out of a man where /you will get/ once a woman to an[swer]. [T]ake a sister &amp; she will cry and look &amp; live in the name of the Lord. [W]hen a man will tell the truth. Men are honest-but women have to be dependent of men for their Salvation, You get a woman that wont lie when punched hard enough &amp; if she wont lie, she is a miracle. I ll tell you I never love a woman so wel[l] that I cannot say good bye. [W]hen men have their affections placed in a woman then they can put a sting-but if you can give all your women a discharge &amp; feel well-I say I m glad to get a preaching Hallelugh-Glory- &amp; when a man dont feel so he is in bondage &amp; I feel will never put fetter in my life.
