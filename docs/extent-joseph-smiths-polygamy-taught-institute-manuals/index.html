    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>An analysis of the two college-level manuals (published in the early 2000s) used
to educate students during the 2000s and early 2010s where we would expect the
most in-depth coverage of Joseph Smith’s polygamy provide only surface-level
discussion.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The gospel topics essay <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo?lang=eng">Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo</a> was published October 22, 2014 <a href="https://www.fox13now.com/2014/10/22/lds-church-issues-new-essays-on-polygamy-acknowledges-joseph-smith-married-teen-girl/">and acknowledged</a> that Joseph “married a girl who was just shy of her 15th birthday” and “that Smith married other men’s wives.”</p>

<p>Previous to late 2014, how much would an LDS student have known about Joseph
Smith’s polygamy? Two college-level manuals seem most likely to have covered
the topic in depth:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Doctrine and Covenants Student Manual (for Religion 324 and 325): <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/shared/content/english/pdf/language-materials/32493_eng.pdf?lang=eng">copyright 1981, 2001</a> and currently <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual-2017/title-page?lang=eng">published on churchofjesuschrist.org</a> (last accessed 2022-04-02) with copyright dates of 2017 and 2018. The manual includes 8 pages focused on <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng">D&amp;C 132</a> which is a “Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Nauvoo, Illinois, recorded July 12, 1843, relating to the new and everlasting covenant, including the eternity of the marriage covenant and the principle of plural marriage.”</li>
  <li>Church History in the Fulness of Times : The History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: second edition <a href="https://archive.org/details/churchhistoryinf00chur/page/n3/mode/2up">copyright 2000</a>. Online version <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/manual/church-history-in-the-fulness-of-times/title-page?lang=eng">copyright 1989, 1993, 2000, and 2003</a> (last accessed 2022-04-02). Chapter 20 is devoted to “Doctrinal Developments in Nauvoo”.</li>
</ol>

<p>In 2018, I performed an electronic search of the online manuals for the
phrases “plural marriage” or “polygamy” and then looked to see if any of the
surrounding text referred in any way to Joseph Smith’s polygamy.</p>

  <p><strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-132-marriage-an-eternal-covenant?lang=eng">D&amp;C 132:51–56. What Was Emma Commanded Not to Partake of?</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>No indication is given here or elsewhere of what the Lord had commanded the
Prophet Joseph to offer to his wife, but the context seems to suggest that
it was a special test of faith similar to the test of Abraham’s faith when
the Lord commanded him to sacrifice Isaac. Beyond that, it is useless to
speculate. However, Emma was given additional counsel from the Lord,
including commandments to “receive all those that have been given to her
husband” (D&amp;C 132:52) to obey the voice of the Lord (see v. 53), to “abide
and cleave unto” the Prophet (v. 54), and to forgive him of his trespasses
(see v. 56). The Lord also gave her warnings against rejecting these
commandments and promises for keeping them.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>President Wilford Woodruff, who was closely associated with the Prophet
Joseph Smith, said: “Emma Smith, the widow of the Prophet, is said to have
maintained to her dying moments that her husband had nothing to do with the
patriarchal order of marriage, but that it was Brigham Young that got that
up. I bear record before God, angels and men that Joseph Smith received that
revelation, and I bear record that Emma Smith gave her husband in marriage
to several women while he was living, some of whom are to-day living in this
city, and some may be present in this congregation, and who, if called upon,
would confirm my words. But lo and behold, we hear of publication after
publication now-a-days, declaring that Joseph Smith had nothing to do with
these things. Joseph Smith himself organized every endowment in our Church
and revealed the same to the Church, and he lived to receive every key of
the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods from the hands of the men who held
them while in the flesh, and who hold them in eternity.” (In Journal of
Discourses, 23:131.)</p>

  <p><strong><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/manual/church-history-in-the-fulness-of-times-student-manual/chapter-twenty?lang=eng">REVELATIONS ON MARRIAGE</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The endowment of the holy priesthood is closely associated with the
principle of eternal marriage. From the beginning of the Restoration,
Latterday Saints have been taught that “marriage is ordained of God unto
man” (D&amp;C 49:15). The marriage covenant has always been understood to be of
great importance. Men in the Church are directed, “Thou shalt love thy wife
with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else” (D&amp;C 42:22).
Church members are not only charged to marry in righteousness, but to have
children and to rear them according to the precepts of the gospel of Jesus
Christ.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shortly after the introduction of the endowment the Prophet revealed that a
married couple could be sealed together by the power of the priesthood for
time and all eternity. Many of the men and women who were endowed were also
sealed by Joseph Smith to their spouses in the marriage covenant. Joseph
taught that the marriage sealing, the endowment, and baptisms for the dead
were to be performed in the house of the Lord and that these ordinances
would be made available to all faithful Saints as soon as the temple was
completed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the spring of 1843, Joseph Smith taught the eternal importance of the
marriage covenant. While visiting the Mormon village of Ramus, twenty miles
southeast of Nauvoo, the Prophet explained to a few members of the Church:
“In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees; “And in order to
obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood
[meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage]; “And if he does not,
he cannot obtain it” (D&amp;C 131:1–3). Later that summer Joseph recorded a
revelation on marriage that incorporated principles that had been revealed
to him as early as 1831 in Kirtland. In it the Lord declared, “If a man
marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and by the new and everlasting
covenant, and it is sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise, by him
who is anointed, unto whom I have appointed this power and the keys of this
priesthood . . . [it] shall be of full force when they are out of the world;
and they shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to
their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their
heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds
forever and ever” (D&amp;C 132:19).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The law of celestial marriage, as outlined in this revelation, also included
the principle of the plurality of wives. In 1831 as Joseph Smith labored on
the inspired translation of the holy scriptures, he asked the Lord how he
justified the practice of plural marriage among the Old Testament
patriarchs. This question resulted in the revelation on celestial marriage,
which included an answer to his question about the plural marriages of the
patriarchs.11</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>First the Lord explained that for any covenant, including marriage, to be
valid in eternity it must meet three requirements (see D&amp;C 132:7): (1) It
must be “made and entered into and sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise.”
(2) It must be performed by the proper priesthood authority. (3) It must be
by “revelation and commandment” through the Lord’s anointed prophet (see
also vv. 18–19). Using Abraham as an example, the Lord said he “received all
things, whatsoever he received, by revelation and commandment, by my word”
(v. 29). Consequently, the Lord asked, “Was Abraham, therefore, under
condemnation? Verily I say unto you, Nay; for I, the Lord, commanded it” (v.
35).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moreover, Joseph Smith and the Church were to accept the principle of plural
marriage as part of the restoration of all things (see v. 45). Accustomed to
conventional marriage patterns, the Prophet was at first understandably
reluctant to engage in this new practice. Due to a lack of historical
documentation, we do not know what his early attempts were to comply with
the commandment in Ohio. His first recorded plural marriage in Nauvoo was to
Louisa Beaman; it was performed by Bishop Joseph B. Noble on 5 April 1841.12
During the next three years Joseph took additional plural wives in
accordance with the Lord’s commands.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As members of the Council of the Twelve Apostles returned from their
missions to the British Isles in 1841, Joseph Smith taught them one by one
the doctrine of plurality of wives, and each experienced some difficulty in
understanding and accepting this doctrine.13 Brigham Young, for example,
recounted his struggle: “I was not desirous of shrinking from any duty, nor
of failing in the least to do as I was commanded, but it was the first time
in my life that I had desired the grave, and I could hardly get over it for
a long time. And when I saw a funeral, I felt to envy the corpse its
situation, and to regret that I was not in the coffin.”14</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>After their initial hesitancy and frustration, Brigham Young and others of
the Twelve received individual confirmations from the Holy Spirit and
accepted the new doctrine of plural marriage. They knew that Joseph Smith
was a prophet of God in all things. At first the practice was kept secret
and was very limited. Rumors began to circulate about authorities of the
Church having additional wives, which greatly distorted the truth and
contributed to increased persecution from apostates and outsiders. Part of
the difficulty, of course, was the natural aversion Americans held against
“polygamy.” This new system appeared to threaten the strongly entrenched
tradition of monogamy and the solidarity of the family structure. Later, in
Utah, the Saints openly practiced “the principle,” but never without
persecution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Church History in the Fulness of Times, 2003 pgs 255-256</em></p>

<p>Notice that even though Louisa Beaman is mentioned, the text does not mention
that she was <em>already married</em>.</p>

<h2 id="discussion-and-conclusion">Discussion and conclusion</h2>

<p>Ultimately, embedded under headers that only indirectly indicate the
discussion of polygamy, a student would learn that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Emma Smith gave her husband in marriage to several women while he was living
(D&amp;C Institute Manual pg 334)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moreover, Joseph Smith and the Church were to accept the principle of plural
marriage as part of the restoration of all things (see v. 45). Accustomed to
conventional marriage patterns, the Prophet was at first understandably
reluctant to engage in this new practice. Due to a lack of historical
documentation, we do not know what his early attempts were to comply with
the commandment in Ohio. His first recorded plural marriage in Nauvoo was to
Louisa Beaman; it was performed by Bishop Joseph B. Noble on 5 April 1841.12
During the next three years Joseph took additional plural wives in
accordance with the Lord’s commands. (pg 256)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is safe to say that an astute college-level student who read both of these
manuals in their entirety would have then understood merely that Joseph Smith
married “several” or “additional” wives (does “several/additional” = 30–40?).
<em>No mention is made of</em>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Polyandry</li>
  <li>Teenage brides</li>
  <li>Fanny Alger (and the problematic nature of that relationship since it occurred before the return of sealing keys)</li>
</ol>

<p>We could also conclude that an astute college-age student could easily have
<em>missed</em> that Joseph Smith had polygamous wives since the topic is given no
emphasis, no distinct headers, very little detail, and no repetition.</p>
