    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Recent <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2024/10/17/latter-day-saints-react-news/">changes to LDS garments for hot climates</a> have sparked discussion about the connection between garments and modesty. Although garments are officially described as symbols of temple covenants, they also seem to function as a modesty standard—especially for women.</p>

<p>Some, like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vikafroelich/reel/DH1e06_yJQN/">LDS media influencer Victoria Froelich</a>, argue that the link between garments and modesty is more cultural than doctrinal. Others maintain that modesty is a core, unchanging principle tied to the garment.</p>

<p>The Church states that garments are symbolic, but modesty is emphasized in official publications, lesson manuals, and Church media. Below is a collection of quotes and materials from <em>churchofjesuschrist.org</em> related to garments and modesty.</p>

<blockquote>

<h3 id="wear-clothing-that-is-garment-appropriate">Wear clothing that is [garment appropriate]</h3>

<p>From <em>Ensign</em> (now <em>Liahona</em>), March 2003 article <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/liahona/2003/03/everything-good-and-beautiful?lang=eng">Everything Good and Beautiful</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Set a family standard by always dressing appropriately yourself. If you have been to the temple, wear clothing that completely covers the garment. Even if you have not yet been to the temple, wear clothing that is appropriate to wear once you have. …</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What Is the Standard?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Church’s basic guidelines on what not to wear are contained in <em>For the Strength of Youth</em>:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Immodest clothing includes short shorts and skirts, tight clothing, shirts that do not cover the stomach, and other revealing attire. Young women should wear clothing that covers the shoulder and avoid clothing that is low-cut in the front or the back or revealing in any other manner. Young men should also maintain modesty in their appearance.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Encourage understanding: Discuss what dressing modestly means (see the “Dress and Appearance” section of <em>For the Strength of Youth</em>). Prepare several posters with “I will dress modestly by …” written at the top. Divide the children into groups, and ask each group to write their commitment to dress modestly or draw a picture of themselves in modest dress on one of the posters. Display the posters in the Primary room.</p>

<p>As quoted in <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2006/06/modesty-matters?lang=eng">Modesty Matters</a>, June 2006:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Protection Against Temptation</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Modesty in dress and manner will assist in protecting against temptation. It may be difficult to find modest clothing, but it can be found with enough effort. … You can be attractive without being immodest. … Draw some rigid parameters, a line in the sand, as it were, beyond which you will not go.”</p>

<h3 id="never-lower-your-standards-of-dress">Never lower your standards of dress</h3>

<p>From the <em>For the Strength of Youth</em> pamphlet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220309023153/https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/shared/content/english/pdf/ForTheStrengthOfYouth-eng.pdf?lang=eng">retrieved from the Wayback Machine, 28 Dec 2019</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Never lower your standards of dress. Do not use a special occasion as an excuse to be immodest. When you dress immodestly, you send a message that is contrary to your identity as a son or daughter of God. You also send the message that you are using your body to get attention and approval.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Immodest clothing is any clothing that is tight, sheer, or revealing in any other manner</strong>. Young women should avoid short shorts and short skirts, shirts that do not cover the stomach, <strong>and clothing that does not cover the shoulders</strong> or is low-cut in the front or the back. Young men should also maintain modesty in their appearance. Young men and young women should be neat and clean and avoid being extreme or inappropriately casual in clothing, hairstyle, and behavior. They should choose appropriately modest apparel when participating in sports. <strong>The fashions of the world will change, but the Lord’s standards will not change.</strong></p>
