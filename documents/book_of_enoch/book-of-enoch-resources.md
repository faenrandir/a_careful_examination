## Introduction

1. [wikipedia: The Book of Giants (A Book of Moses connection)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Giants#A_'Book_of_Moses'_connection)
1. [The Return of the Book of Enoch, Part 13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1977/08/a-strange-thing-in-the-land-the-return-of-the-book-of-enoch-part-13?lang=eng) (Hugh Nibley's 1977 Ensign article)
1. [Could Joseph Smith Have Drawn on Ancient Manuscripts When He Translated the Story of Enoch?: Recent Updates on a Persistent Question](https://journal.interpreterfoundation.org/could-joseph-smith-have-drawn-on-ancient-manuscripts-when-he-translated-the-story-of-enoch-recent-updates-on-a-persistent-question/) (Interpreter)


## Critical

1. [Revisiting Joseph Smith and the Availability of the Book of Enoch](https://www.dialoguejournal.com/articles/revisiting-joseph-smith-and-the-availability-of-the-book-of-enoch/) (Colby Townsend's Dialogue Fall 2020 article)
1. [Returning to the Sources: Integrating Textual Criticism in the Study of Early Mormon Texts and History](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/imwjournal/vol10/iss1/6/) (Colby Townsend's Intermountain West Journal of Religious Studies 2019 article with a section on Mahijah, Mahujah, and Mahaway)

## Apologetic

1. [Textual Criticism and the Book of Moses: A Response to Colby Townsend’s “Returning to the Sources,” Part 1 of 2](https://journal.interpreterfoundation.org/textual-criticism-and-the-book-of-moses-a-response-to-colby-townsends-returning-to-the-sources-part-1-of-2/) (Interpreter 2020)

    Contains a response to Townsend's argument that the occurrence of Mahijah was the result of misreading Emma's handwriting of Mahujah.
    
1.  [Where Did the Names Mahaway and Mahujah Come From? A Response to Colby Townsend’s “Returning to the Sources,” Part 2 of 2](https://journal.interpreterfoundation.org/where-did-the-names-mahaway-and-mahujah-come-from-a-response-to-colby-townsends-returning-to-the-sources-part-2-of-2/) (Interpreter 2020)

    Pushes back against Townsend's argument that Mahaway from the Qumran Book of Giants scroll is not a good linguistic match for Mahijah/Mahujah from the book of Moses.
