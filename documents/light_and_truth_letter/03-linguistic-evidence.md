[very rough draft]

# Linguistic Evidence

> <span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> There are 188 unique names in the Book of Mormon that are not found in the Bible. Many of these names are Hebrew or Egyptian in origin, which is to be expected for a people who emigrated from ancient Jerusalem in 600 B.C.

First, we should note that, according to Sandra Tanner, 141 names found in the Book of Mormon _are_ from the Bible. She noted [some patterns with many of the others](http://utlm.org/onlineresources/bomnames.htm):

> Many names not found in the Bible seem to be made up by re-arranging various syllables or changing the ending of Bible names. For example, the Bible speaks of Abinadab, the Book of Mormon mentions Abinadi and Abinadom.. Smith's book also uses the Biblical Aminadab and a modified Aminodi. The Bible mentions Kish, the Book of Mormon has Akish and Kishcumen. The Bible has Gimzo, the Book of Mormon speaks of Gimgimno. Besides using the Biblical name Helam, Smith's book expands it to Helaman. The Book of Mormon uses the Biblical name of Antipas and builds on it to form these Book of Mormon names: Anti-Nephi-Lehi, Antiomno, Antion, Antionah, Antionum, Antiparah and Antipus. Some seem to be simply different spellings. Melech in the Bible becomes Melek in the Book of Mormon. In like manner, Nahum becomes Nahom.

And,

> More names are created by adding such endings as "hah." The Book of Mormon has the names Nephi and Nephihah; Moroni and Moronihah; Ammon and Ammonihah; Mathoni and Mathonihah. Some names seem to be just extensions of the same Book of Mormon word. For example, Antion seems to be the base for Antionah, Antionum and Antiomno. Book of Mormon Shim is expanded to Shimnilon. Corianton is slightly changed to make the additional names of Coriantor, Coriantum and Coriantumr. Smith's book uses the Biblical word Gideon and shortens it to Gid, then expands it to Giddianhi, Giddonah, Gidgiddonah and Gidgiddoni. Riplah seems to be the base for Riplakish and Ripliancum.

Others have noted [potential sources](https://web.archive.org/web/20200206052103/http://lds-mormon.com/names.shtml) for ~200 Book of Mormon names.

Potential Egyptian Book of Mormon Names	Potential Old-World Connection

    * Aha – A name of the first Pharaoh; it means “warrior” and is a common word.

> <span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> Most, if not all, of the listed connections were unknown in 1830.

As demonstrated, somewhat who had been steeped in the Bible or from Joseph Smith's milieu could have constructed the above names by riffing on names he would have read or heard before.

> <span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> Nephi – Listed in the table above. John Gee alternately argues that “Nephi” could be derived from the ancient Egyptian “nfr,” meaning “good” or “beautiful”.2 If so, isn’t it interesting that Nephi repeats the theme of “goodness” throughout his writings? That would make a creative triple pun3 in the first verse of the Book of Nephi:

>> <span style="color:red; margin-left:-10px;"> “I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.”
