## Introduction

A common refrain heard when members of the LDS Church express when discussing
those who have left and are still vocal about the Church, its history, or its
culture is "You can leave the Church but you can't leave it alone."

The statement indicates that when a person leaves the Church they will
(likely?) continue to argue against, or at least be interested in, the Church.
At its most innocuous, the statement may be viewed as neutral or value
free---it is merely an _observation_ about the behavior of former members that
they continue to be involved in or concerned with LDS matters even after
having left. In fact, this document does not seek to counter the observation that at least some
significant fraction of former members seem to fixate on the LDS Church, the
actions of its leaders, its history, or its truth-claims for some length of
time following their departure.[^survivorship_bias]

However, members often use the statement in a manner that seems to invalidate the
perspective of former members. This document briefly explores the history of
the phrase and likely intended meaning of the phrase when used colloquially,
examines the proportionality of behavior of former members in _contrast to_
active members of the Church, and then concludes by advancing and defending
valid reasons why some members might focus on the LDS Church for some time
even after their departure.

## Historical analysis

In 2008, LDS scholar Blair Dee Hodges investigated the origin of the phrase in [a detailed blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20210609080651/http://lifeongoldplates.blogspot.com/2008/08/they-leave-church-but-cant-leave-it.html) and, along with other helpful commenters, was able to piece together a reasonable chronology of its inception and usage.  He also pin-pointed the similarity between Maxwell's statement and a story, used frequently in official and unofficial LDS literature, where Joseph Smith describes the necessary trajectory of apostates if they leave the Church.



### Following the dictation of the evil one

Official LDS literature includes a direct example of a member discussing how _they_ would leave Mormonism alone and not attack it, were they to leave the Church.  The example is found frequently in official LDS literature.[^implication]  In this example, Joseph Smith responds to the individual claiming that they would leave "Mormonism" alone were they to leave by saying:

> When you [enlisted to serve God (by joining the Church)] you left the neutral ground, and you never can get back on to it. Should you forsake the Master you enlisted to serve, it will be by the instigation of the evil one, and you will follow his dictation and be his servant.’

### Guilt

The [semi-official Encyclopedia of Mormonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia_of_Mormonism) has an entry for "Apostate" and their explanation of Apostate behavior seems to hinge on "guilt" as the driving motivator for former members' continued attention:

> Apostates sometimes become enemies of the Church. Leaving the Church, which claims to be God’s official church, containing the fulness of the gospel, often results in feelings of guilt. While many return, others develop a need to defend their actions, “disprove” the Church, or become hostile enemies. The fruits of apostasy are generally bitter.

The LDS blogger Jeremy Goff, in his article "Why Ex-Mormons Can’t Leave The Church Alone" writes:

> Members who leave the church know that their actions are wrong. Deep inside they feel guilty that they are denying their witnesses from the Holy Ghost and forsaking Christ and His gospel. That guilt is demoralizing. They are faced with two options, have the integrity to admit they are wrong and repent, or lie to themselves and rationalize their actions.

### The intended effect?

The intended effect of using the phrase seems to be the marginalization of the former member and their perspective: the _content_ of a former member's concerns or expressions can be more easily dismissed whole-cloth without because, to the believing member, the former-member is merely on "auto-pilot"---why should a member carefully consider the perspective of a guilt-ridden agent of Satan seeking for others to be miserable like them (see [2 Nephi 2:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=27) and [Modern-Day Korihors](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/new-era/2013/03/modern-day-korihors?lang=eng))?

## Proportionality





## Inaccurate?

## Family entanglement

Family entanglement.  Former member lives are often still impacted by the
culture and practices of the LDS Church. I have siblings and parents in the
Church, and may former members have children and spouses who still attend.

## Political entanglement

I live in Provo, Utah, so the LDS Church and its culture and policy impacts
political decisions and those decisions influence me, or my nation, directly.

Many LDS politicians are strongly influenced by LDS doctrine in how they
approach legislation. For example:

* [Gordon Smith discusses politics with LDS leadership]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4FPVZH8fIg)
* [David Farnsworth](https://www.yahoo.com/news/spent-two-half-hours-david-130000672.html)

    > My foundation is the doctrine of my church, and it flavors everything I do ... I believe this is the word of God. I'm reading the Old Testament right now, three chapters every morning. Really enjoying it.

    > ... returning to the subject of the nondiscrimination bill. "It is contrary to our church doctrine," he said, pointing to the church's 1995 proclamation stating that marriage is between one man and one woman.

## Life experience

I spent 38 years of my life (at this point ~83% of my entire life) as a
dedicated member. It frames who I am and how I think. Virtually all my
formative experiences were made from within the LDS framework. How do I even
interact with the world except from within that framework, at least in some
significant ways?



## Positive motivations.

Many former members feel like not knowing about the truth-claim data can cause
people harm. They felt compelled to leave after understanding the data, so
they think others deserve to know about it, also.  Few of them wish to compel
others to leave, they simply want others to have all the information to make
an informed choice.

### [Brainstorm]

* informed consent, caring, leaving a burning building (or abuser)
processing a monumental life transition
    - if they love you, then they want to process that transition with you,
    somehow. Unfortunately, this often feels like a personal attack since the
    Church is tied into identity.
    - countless life decisions were informed by their membership
    - accepted the package of decisions and now are needing to grow into this
    new role very rapidly
* perpetual reminders
* not enough people who understand, so want to process with those who understand their
  life experience

[^leaving_quietly]: This is my sense from reading their work. Cragun and Reiss who have done extensive research on the question of LDS membership rates, demographics, and other related questions. Quantifying this kind of thing is difficult, and I would love to better substantiate this point.
[^implication]: The story of Joseph Smith's response to Isaac Behunin, as recounted by Daniel Tyler (e.g., see [this lesson manual](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-27?lang=eng) is frequently conveyed in official LDS literature---a search on 2022-08-04 for the phrase "left the neutral ground" from the story retrieves 13 instances of its usage on churchofjesuschrist.org). The story begins with Isaac and Daniel visiting Joseph Smith and hearing Joseph recount among other things the "many false, inconsistent and contradictory statements made by apostates." Isaac responded by saying that if _he_ were to leave he would "go to some remote place where Mormonism had never been heard of, settle down, and no one would ever learn that I knew anything about it." Joseph Smith responded, according to Tyler, by saying that in joining the Church Isaac had "enlisted to serve God" and "When you did that you left the neutral ground, and you never can get back on to it. Should you forsake the Master you enlisted to serve, it will be by the instigation of the evil one, and you will follow his dictation and be his servant." Ben Arkell appeals directly to this story when discussing the idea that former members can leave but they can't leave it alone in [this essay](https://web.archive.org/web/20220804203959/https://www.calledtoshare.com/2020/05/25/why-people-who-leave-the-church-cant-leave-it-alone/).


[^survivorship_bias]: While some former members clearly spend some time after their departure still focused on the LDS Church, it may be the case that many do not and the observation may, in fact, be a form of survivorship bias: the former members who are most noticed by LDS members are those who still engage.
