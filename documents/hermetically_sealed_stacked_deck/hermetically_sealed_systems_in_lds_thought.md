## Introduction

A hermetic seal is one which is entirely airtight (see an example of a hermetically sealed vial to the right). A hermetically sealed system of thought is, by analogy, one which is cutoff from, or virtually impervious to, outside ways of thinking.[^hermetically_sealed]

<div style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 0px: margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
    <img style="margin: 0px" src="../media/hermetically_sealed_neon_gas.png" alt="A vial of hermetically sealed neon gas">
    <p style="margin:2px; width: 180px; font-size: 80%"><em>A hermetically sealed vial of Neon gas.</em></p>
</div>

Perhaps such a system of thought arises when a person accepts one or more assumptions (sometimes unawares) which then prevent them from ever arriving at conclusions outside the resulting system of thought.  From *within* the system it appears that the full range of choices and possibilities are available, but the thought structure (constrained by the adoption of certain assumptions or premises) makes some conclusions impossible (or at least difficult) to access.

Hermetically sealed systems of thought, as described in this document, may be viewed as a subset of the greater [socializing influence of the LDS Church and its culture]({{ "/lds-indoctrination-and-retentive-socialization/" | relative_url }}) which by some measure discourages members from exploring alternative approaches or worldviews. Alternatively, the systems of thought I diagram below may be viewed as a yet unprobed/untested variant of psychological phenomena that might influence a person's choices, such as [framing effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_%28psychology%29).

## Structure, Veracity, and Agency

These diagrams say nothing (directly) about how well these systems of thought coincide with reality.  However, examining the systems of thought in this form may make it easier for the reader to determine if the systems are veridical (i.e., coincide with reality). And, regardless of whether these systems of thought are veridical, their structure may demonstrate aspects of LDS thought which may inhibit members and investigators from exploring the full latitude of thought as they consider alternative models in approaching LDS truth claims.

## Hermetically sealed systems in LDS thought

<br>

### 1\. On seeking revelation

![Sealed system - do not seek revelation on that which contradicts the Brethren](../media/01-dont_seek_revelation_on_contradictory.png)

**Figure 1: Do not seek revelation on that which contradicts the Brethren.**

Assumption derived from Foundations of the Restoration Teacher Manual (Religion 225) [lesson 20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/foundations-of-the-restoration-teacher-manual/lesson-20-plural-marriage?lang=eng#p36):

> We should not seek to receive revelation that is contrary to what the Lord has revealed through His prophets.

---

<br>

### 2\. Divine origin of teachings

![Sealed system - revelations contradictin the Brethren](../media/02-revelations_contradicting_brethren_not_from_god.png)

**Figure 2: Revelations contradicting the Brethren are not from God.**

Assumption derived from a 1913 First Presidency Statement about erroneous doctrine (as found in the D&C Student Manual for Religion 324 and 325, [Enrichment J-7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/enrichment-j-keys-for-avoiding-deception?lang=eng)):

> When ... inspiration conveys something out of harmony with the accepted revelations of the Church or contrary to the decisions of its constituted authorities, Latter-day Saints may know that it is not of God, no matter how plausible it may appear.

---

<br>

### 3\. Certainty of prayer

![Sealed system - all answers to prayer are correct](../media/03-prayers_are_always_answered.png)

**Figure 3: All answers to prayer are ultimately correct.**

Assumption derived from Jeffrey R. Holland's [Wrong Roads](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/video/wrong-roads) (Inspirational Message):

> Somewhere along the way Matt said, "Dad, why did we feel, after praying about it, that the right road was the proper one to take, the correct one to take, and it wasn't?" I think that the Lord, his wish for us there, and his answer to our prayer, was to get us on the right road as quickly as possible with some reassurance, with some understanding that we were on the right road and we didn't have to worry about it.

---

<br>

### 4\. Moroni's promise

![Sealed system - Moroni's Promise](../media/04-pray_about_bom.png)

**Figure 4: Follow Moroni's Promise to know that the Book of Mormon is true.**

For assumption sources, see [Supplement to Sealed System #4 (Moroni's Promise)](#supplement-to-sealed-system-4-moronis-promise).

---

<br>

### 5\. Those who preach false doctrine

![Sealed system - the ignorant and proud](../media/05-lazy_or_proud.png)

**Figure 5: Invariably, only the ignorant and proud disagree with accepted LDS doctrine.**

Assumption derived from Teachings of the Prophet Joseph F. Smith [chapter 13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teachings-joseph-f-smith/chapter-13?lang=eng):

> Among the Latter-day Saints, the preaching of false doctrines disguised as truths of the gospel, may be expected from people of two classes, and practically from these only; they are:

> First—The hopelessly ignorant, whose lack of intelligence is due to their indolence and sloth, who make but feeble effort, if indeed any at all, to better themselves by reading and study; those who are afflicted with a dread disease that may develop into an incurable malady—laziness.

> Second—The proud and self-vaunting ones, who read by the lamp of their own conceit; who interpret by rules of their own contriving; who have become a law unto themselves, and so pose as the sole judges of their own doings. More dangerously ignorant than the first.

> Beware of the lazy and the proud.

<br>

### 6\. Doubt your doubts

![Sealed system - ](../media/06-doubt_your_doubts.png)

**Figure 6: Ask the right questions and doubt your doubts.**

## Supplements

### Supplement to Sealed System #4 (Moroni's Promise)

Follow Moroni's Promise to know that the Book of Mormon is true

#### Moroni's Promise

[Moroni 10:3--5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.3-5?lang=eng)

> 3 Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if
> it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember
> how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the
> creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these
> things, and ponder it in your hearts.

> 4 And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye
> would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these
> things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with
> real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it
> unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.

> 5 And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all
> things.

#### Pray about the Book of Mormon to know that it is true.

[Moroni 10:3--4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.3-4?lang=eng)

> Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things ...
> that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if
> these things are not true; ...

#### Did you feel good or peaceful? Were you enlightened?

[Moroni 10:4--5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.4-5?lang=eng)

> ... he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the
> Holy Ghost. And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth
> of all things.

The Preach My Gospel Manual ([pg 103--104](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/how-do-i-recognize-and-understand-the-spirit?lang=eng)) contains a table which is meant to be used "to help others feel and recognize the Spirit." The missionary is encouraged: "Think of times when you have experienced any of the feelings, thoughts, or impressions described in the passages below." The following are included and are representative of the more generic aspects:

- "Gives feelings of love, joy, peace, patience, meekness, gentleness, faith, and hope."
- "Gives ideas in the mind, feelings in the heart."
- "Gives good feelings to teach if something is true."
- "Enlightens the mind."
- "Gives feelings of peace and comfort."

#### Did you pray with a sincere heart?

[Moroni 10:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.4?lang=eng) "... if ye shall ask with a sincere heart ..."

#### Did you study it out first?

A revelation received during the translation of the Book of Mormon, D&C 9:7--8 ("Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me. But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right ...") and the study that preceded the First Vision [suggests to Latter-day Saints](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormondebate/comments/kqi0nr/there_is_no_way_to_know_that_any_religion_is_the/gltssa5/) that "when ye shall receive these things" implies serious study.

[Moroni 10:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.4?lang=eng) "... and when ye shall receive these things ..."

#### Did you pray with real intent, having faith in Christ?

[Moroni 10:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.4?lang=eng) "... with real intent, having faith in Christ ..."

"[Praying with Real Intent](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/ensign/2016/02/latter-day-saint-voices/praying-with-real-intent?lang=eng)" Ensign, Feb 2016.

> One afternoon they \[the missionaries\] asked me, "Have you prayed to
> find out if what we are teaching you is true?"

> I told them I had but had not obtained any answer.

> "You must pray with real intent," they said.

#### Did you ask God in the name of Jesus Christ?

[Moroni 10:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.4?lang=eng) "... ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ ..."

Latter-day Saints [believe this is important](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormondebate/comments/kqi0nr/there_is_no_way_to_know_that_any_religion_is_the/gltssa5/) to receiving an answer.

#### Did you ponder on the mercy of God first? Did you read the Bible first?

A common interpretation (taught in the Scotland, Edinburgh mission
while I was there from 1995--1997, for instance) is that a person must
also read and study the Bible because otherwise how can they ponder on
how God has dealt with the children of men from the creation of Adam
until the present time?

[Moroni 10:3--4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.3-4?lang=eng)

> 3 Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, ...
> that ye would remember how **merciful** the Lord hath been unto the
> children of men, **from the creation of Adam even down until the time
> that ye shall receive these things**, and **ponder it in your
> hearts**. \[emphasis added\]

#### Have you prayed tens or hundreds of times?

There are many examples of leaders or members encouraging people to continue trying if they do not receive an answer. In some cases, the suggestion is that it may take many years before receiving confirmation.

"[Securing Our Testimonies](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/general-conference/2004/10/securing-our-testimonies?lang=eng&_r=1)". Donald L. Staheli. General Conference, Oct 2004.

> Recently I had an engaging conversation with a young man
> who was contemplating a mission. As we talked, it became apparent that
> he was struggling with his decision, because he was questioning the
> strength of his testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. He wanted to
> know why he had not received more clear answers to his prayers and

> ...First, we must have a sincere desire to believe. Phrases such as
> "awake," "arouse your faculties," "experiment," and "exercise a

> timely as you would like, but keep praying.

> I\'ve gone to church the last two Sundays and I think it\'s fantastic.
> I really like a lot of the ideals of the church. I\'m already living
> by the word of wisdom, and I\'m following the commandments, and

#### You've *always* known that it's true. Stop asking God for a sign.

> I believed that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ had spoken to
> Joseph Smith when he was 14, so I thought that since I was now 14,
> Heavenly Father could tell me, too. I didn't expect a vision, but I
> believed God would somehow let me know if this was His Church. I

> During the meeting, I listened intently to the

"[Is It True?](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/new-era/1999/02/is-it-true?lang=eng)" New Era, Feb 1999.

#### Why would God answer when you took not thought except to ask.

### Supplement to Sealed System #6 (doubt your doubts)

#### Honest doubts lead to increased faith.

#### Answers given to those who don't harden their hearts.

## Appendix 

### Appendix 1 - Examples from other groups

Some examples from other totalistic groups are easy to identity and show similarities with some LDS hermetically sealed thought. The following are two examples from the Jehovah's Witnesses.

#### Example 1: do not communicate with former JWs

**Assumed**: To love God means to entirely avoid communication with a former Jehovah’s Witness.

**Innaccessible**: Exposure to criticism from former Jehovah’s Witnesses.

**Example**:

> …should we listen to apostates, read their literature, or examine their Web sites on the Internet? If we love God and the truth, we will not do so. We should not allow apostates into our homes or even greet them, for such actions would make us ‘sharers in their wicked works.’ (2 John 9-11) (source)

#### Example 2: will miss the good if you focus on the bad

**Assumed**: You will miss the good and only see bad if you focus on the flaws of the organization or leaders.

**Innaccessible**: Aspects of the organization or the actions or teachings of some leaders may be ethically deficient but may be un-observable if one only focuses on the good.

**Example**:

> Every person in this organization–every one of Jehovah’s Witnesses including the governing body–we’re all imperfect and thus we are subject to making mistakes. Which means that if you look hard enough, all you will see instead of seeing these amazing things that Jehovah is accomplishing and our tremendous privilege of being part of it, all we are going to see is the errors of men. But when we focus on the good, on the guidance and loving support that we’ve received, aren’t we moved with appreciation to cleave to this body of fellow worshipers. And just look at what Jehovah is accomplishing by means of his imperfect servants. There is no other organization on earth providing spiritual food like the one that we belong to. When we look at all of this, how could we possibly let the failings of just a few people undermine this overwhelming proof of Jehova’s backing? (From the 2016 “Remain Loyal To Jehovah” regional convention)

### Appendix 2 - Potential Criticisms

I have encountered some criticism of this work in public discussion and can imagine other potential criticism. I will present the criticism and then some thoughts on its validity.

#### The diagrams are too reductive.

One might argue that LDS thought allows for the contemplation of the inaccessible thoughts in other ways or contained in other leader statements not represented here.

**Response**: There is some validity to this concern. A more complete analysis might assemble _every_ statement (or some large sampling) made by leaders or in lesson manuals on a topic and examine the frequency of a particular logical path in all the relevant statements. A single example cannot demonstrate the _predominance_ of such a thought-pattern, only that such a routing exists and has been employed in official LDS material in at least one instance.  I have made an effort to include patterns that seem dominant (or frequent) to my mind, but without demonstration a person may easily argue that it does not represent the sum of the data or of _their_ personal experience.[^retentive_socialization]

#### No guarantee of inaccessibility

The explicit enumeration of choices by itself does not guarantee the inaccessibility of the outside conclusion.

**Response**: Because LDS thought extends beyond any individual statement and the realm of philosophical thought broadly construed can be viewed as superseding LDS theology or doctrine narrowly defined, that will always be true. Still, when the explicit enumeration of choices does not include a particular possibility, it seems reasonable that a member is then required to shoulder the burden of injecting, mentally constructing, or borrowing such a possibility on their own, and this may not reliably occur and arguably requires more effort to summon.  In any case, it seems reasonable to assume that a person is likely to spontaneously produce alternatives less frequently in instances where the alternative is not enumerated.

#### Every system of thought is hermetically sealed

It may be argued that all systems of thought are hermetically sealed in some fashion.[^riskas]

**Response**: In 1931 [Kurt Gödel demonstrated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) that to some extent, all logical systems contain one or more true statements which are inaccessible from within that system and the system itself cannot demonstrate its own consistency. Such is the case, for instance, with the scientific method (e.g., the scientific method is incapable of demonstrating that the method itself is valid---demonstrations of that kind lie outside the scientific method). Further, many domains which we typically acknowledge as conveying intrinsic value still suffer from foundational instabilities.[^psychology] In some sense, then, demonstrating which statements are inaccessible from within a system of thought does not, by itself, demonstrate the system invalid. Regardless, it still seems reasonable to think that examination of inaccessible (or at least difficult to access) statements may be a fruitful exercise and differences in topology between systems may mean some are more or less open to scrutiny or more or less prone to circularities than alternatives.

#### "Brainwashing" is not scientific

One might argue that discussing thought patterns in this form is similar to counter-cult research seeking to demonstrate "mind-control" (which ultimately has been of dubious value), and most of these ideas have a tenuous relationship (at best) with mainstream psychological research.

**Response**: Significant endeavors that seem somewhat similar to cataloging hermetically sealed systems generally include Robert J. Lifton's [Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_Reform_and_the_Psychology_of_Totalism), the DIMPAC report (which was dismissed by the American Psychological Association), Steven Hassan's BITE model (outlined in [his dissertation](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2476570146/) and [applied in one peer reviewed article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352552519300118?via%3Dihub)) and more generally the idea of [the thought-terminating cliche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought-terminating_clich%C3%A9), [indoctrination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoctrination) (or socialization), and [linguistic relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity). Some of these ideas have been rejected by mainstream scientists (e.g., the DIMPAC report) and many others are under-developed academically (e.g., indoctrination, thought-terminating cliche), or lack widespread academic adoption (e.g., the BITE model).[^luna_lindsey_corbden] I am aware of some of the controversies with the work and frameworks listed above and have argued in favor of academically mainstream approaches (e.g., my argument [against using the BITE model to label the LDS Church a "cult"](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/asking-if-its-a-cult-is-wrong-question/) and [dismissal of the idea of "brainwashing" in favor of a social learning framework](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/lds-indoctrination-and-retentive-socialization/)).

Regardless, exploration of hermetically sealed systems of thought seems to be at home among legitimate psychological research demonstrating, for instance, the human propensity to be swayed by [framing effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_%28psychology%29).

[^hermetically_sealed]: As indicated, a hermetic seal was originally used to describe a physical phenomenon. The term "hermetically sealed" appears to have been used somewhat abstractly at least by the early 1800s (e.g., [pg 4 of this 1808 book](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Prison_Lucubrations_or_Letters_from_that/zHpjAAAAcAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22hermetically+sealed%22&pg=PA4&printsec=frontcover) or [criticized in this 1816 Irish publication](https://www.google.com/books/edition/No_III/o55KAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22hermetically+sealed%22&pg=PA73&printsec=frontcover). In more modern times, it is commonly used in the same fashion as I have used it here (e.g., [Keesing](https://twren.sites.luc.edu/phil389&elps423/keesing.htm), "Their cultures are hermetically sealed, beyond the reaches of time and the world system."; Or in [this 2017 abstract](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29124696/), "The ... medical approach represents a paradigm shift from a strictly biomedical view of health and disease taken as hermetically sealed compartments to a more interdisciplinary one.")

[^riskas]: Thomas Riskas in [Deconstructing Mormonism: An Analysis and Assessment of the Mormon Faith](https://www.worldcat.org/title/666406342) examines various circularities and deficiencies within LDS theology and practice from a more philosophical perspective, likening believers to being trapped in a box with instructions for exit on the outside.  A full review of Riskas's work is outside the scope of this short essay, but [in his review of Riskas](https://journal.interpreterfoundation.org/sophic-box-and-mantic-vista-a-review-of-deconstructing-mormonism/), Kevin Christensen basically argues that Riskas is guilty of leaning too heavily on logical positivism without acknowledging its inherent circularities.  I have tried to steer clear of insinuating the supremacy of alternative systems of thought and freely acknowledge intrinsic limitations of all frames of reference.

[^retentive_socialization]: Certain themes [appear frequently within the LDS Church](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/lds-indoctrination-and-retentive-socialization/) and many of these ideas, manifest in a variety of ways, encourage members to remain members.  In very broad stroke, one can argue that the consequences for leaving a religion is typically [proportional to the level of totalism of the group](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/consequences-of-leaving-the-group-and-totalism/).

[^psychology]: An example of a useful discipline that has been dogged with foundational instability is the field of psychology as discussed by [Yurevich in 2009](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19067090/).

[^luna_lindsey_corbden]: Within the realm of LDS thought, Luna Lindsey Corbden explores modes of influence and persuasion from a psychological perspective in [Recovering Agency: Lifting the Veil of Mormon Mind Control](https://www.worldcat.org/title/1039888665). In public discussions of the book ([for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFyVcsLK_dM)) she tends to acknowledge deficiencies of the counter-cult frameworks, but it is not clear if Corbden fully transcends those concerns within the book itself, which tends to lean on the frameworks of Lifton and Hassan.
