In [The Complete Record of the Nauvoo Library and Literary Institute](https://ensignpeakfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/The-Complete-Record-of-the-Nauvoo-Library-and-Literary-Institute.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3GzV1T-sx-_luy2HcA8j3iasy0aBlURHeh_66vOEamijfX1qWtLJ0q_uQ)   (Mormon Historical Studies 10:1, 2009: pgs 180–204) Christopher C. Jones transcribes the entire record of the Nauvoo Library and Literary Institute. It includes a ledger of books donated and payment received and includes a donation of 38 works by Joseph Smith. The list of those 38 books is reproduced below, along with links to the work online where available.

### Acknowledgement

I was only able to locate a few of these on my own, but redditor `TruthIsAntiMormon` found likely or certain candidates for almost all of them. So, the vast majority of the links and notes are in debt to his research. These were shared as two parts of "Books that Joseph Smith owned as of 1844 and donated to the Nauvoo Library and Literary Institute (closest approximation)":

([link to English](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_History_of_the_Reign_of_the_Emperor/hhmzKYG0vuMC?hl=en&gbpv=0)).

[^metropolitan]: is most likely a volume of [“The Metropolitan” magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metropolitan_Magazine) or the [“Encyclopædia Metropolitana”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Metropolitana) published in multi volumes. No volume is specified.

[^parkers_lectures]: this is “Lectures on Universalism” by Joel Parker published in at least 2 editions from before the 1840’s.

By Daniel C. Sanders, A.M. President of the University of Vermont, in Burlington.” (full title) I couldn’t find an online version of this.

[^dictionary_of_the_holy_bible]: this is most likely “A Dictionary of the Holy Bible” by John Brown published multiple times through the 18th and 19th Century. 

[^beaumonts_experiments]: this is “Experiments and Observations on the Gastric Juice, and the Physiology of Digestion” by William Beaumont.

[^dicks_philosophy]: ...

[^mosheims]: [this] is "Mosheim's Church history, of the first two centuries" published multiple times before 1845. This is the 1847 edition."

[^studies_in_poetry_and_prose]: [it] is this book from either 1832 or 1837 (same book) by A.B. Cleveland.

[^browns_english]: This is actually misnamed. It's Brown's English Syntax (or American Syntax) [with [Library of Congress link](https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.exegesisofenglis00brow/?c=160&sp=1&st=gallery)]

[^browns_grammar]: This is actually misnamed. It's Brown's American Grammar.

[^rebel]: This is misnamed. It's actually "The Rebel And Other Tales, Etc. in Prose and Verse" By [Edward Bulwer Lytton Baron Lytton](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=ad3cebe3ffb4734a&hl=en&sxsrf=ADLYWILr7f7Eo-1GeV_CDKBDXm7JZ1Kptg:1724101266928&q=inauthor:%22Edward+Bulwer+Lytton+Baron+Lytton%22&tbm=bks), 1835.

[^bruns_travels]: This is "A new and more correct translation than has hitherto appeared in public, of Mr. Cornelius Le Brun's Travels into Moscovy, Persia, and divers parts of the East-Idies; containing an accurate description of all such articles as are most remarkable in each of those different countries. As also, of their antiquities; but more particularly those relating to the famous palace of Persepolis, commonly called Chelminar by the Persians" by [Bruyn, Cornelis de, 1652-1727](https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22Bruyn%2C+Cornelis+de%2C+1652-1727%22) (1759).

[^apocryphal_testament]: this is William Hone's 1820's printing (He also printed "the Chronicle of Abomilech").

[^gillmores]: [this] is "Lectures on the Evidences of Christianity Wherein Its Necessity, Authenticity, and Utility are Supported ; by Evidences Historical, Philosophical, Experimental, and Miscellaneous ; with an Affectionate Appeal to Those who Have Been Entangled in the Same Snare of Infidelity" by Hiram Gillmore.

[^catholic_piety]: this one I don't know for sure but probably any number of the early 1800's publications of: The Christian's Guide to Heaven; Or, a Complete Manual of Catholic Piety. Containing a Selection of Fervent Prayers, Pious Reflections, Etc. It's called the above and just "Guide to heaven", "The path to paradise" or "Complete Manual of Catholic Piety", etc. Here's one [the one I have linked above] from Dublin circa 1844.

[^krumanachers]: this is misspelled and refers to Friedrich Adolph Krummacher. The book in question is this one published in 1841 and containing "Jacob wrestling with the Angel" and "Solomon and Shulamite". A couple of pages after the title is a page that's printed "Krummacher's Works."

[^epicureo]: this title is most likely misspelled. [TIAM points to a few potential works in Spanish and Italian, but settles on it being a reference to Moore's 1827 "The Epicurean: A Tale" as most likely candidate.]

[^on_the_will]: This is "A review of Edward's 'Inquiry into the freedom of the will.'" by Henry Philip Tappan (1838) and is a refutation of Jonathan Edwards "Inquiry into the freedom of the will".

[^whepleys]: This is most likely "Whepley's Compendium of the Practice of Medicine" by Samuel Whepley. I could not find an edition online but it appears to have been published around 1834 (and possibly before and after). It's a medical remedy book from what I can tell.

[^scotts]: this refers to "The Poetical Works of Sir Walter Scott, Bar" compiled/printed by Robert Cadell in London in 1833 (possibly reprinted in the US before 1844) but was printed as a 10 or 11 or 12 volume set. Apparently 5 volumes were donated at $.40 each.

[^old_world_notes]: This is most likely Orville Dewey (Unitarian)'s Volume 1 of a two volume set. "The Old World and the New, 1836, Vol. 1 of 2: Or a Journal of Reflections and Observations Made on a Tour in Europe" I could only find Vol 2 alone but both volumes were included in the below "The Works of Orville Dewey" and Volume 1 would have been chapters 1 through chapter 11, (Chapter 12 onward is in Vol. 2).

[^voyage_and_travels_notes]: [this] is "The Voyages and Travels of Captains Parry, Franklin, Ross, and Mr. Belzoni Forming an Interesting History of the Manners, Customs, and Characters of Various Nations, Visited by Enterprising Travellers" published in 1829 and 1835.

[^yucatan_vol_2]: Links to a reprint from 1855.

[^millenium_and_other_poems]: This is the 1839 printing of Parley P. Pratt’s “The Millenium & Other Poems.”
