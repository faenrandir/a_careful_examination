At the end of her discussion of Joseph Smith's polygamy with Patrick Mason on the Nov 4, 2025 Faith Matters podcast, Laurel Thatcher Ulrich (an [esteemed LDS historian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurel_Thatcher_Ulrich)) was discussing the legacy of Joseph Smith's polygamy.  

> ...And then it comes to the crisis of faith. People are heartbroken you know, who really feel the Spirit and then read things and learn things that yeah, Joseph Smith was not a perfect person. You can't read the evidence and not know that he, **obviously he lied**. (emphasis added)
